    This Blocks implementation is an adaptation [a report written](https://erlj.notion.site/Neural-Instrument-Cloning-from-very-few-samples-2cf41d8b630842ee8c7eb55036a1bfd6) by Nicolas Jonason and Bob L.T. Sturm.
    
    I've implemented it in Blocks to show off some cool features, such as embedding live ML demos. More on that ahead...
    
    ### What does this machine learning model do?
    It combines techniques from neural voice cloning with musical instrument synthesis. This makes it possible to produce neural instrument synthesisers from just seconds of target instrument audio.

    Here are some **real** 16 second saxophone recordings:
