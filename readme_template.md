# Gradio: Build Machine Learning Web Apps — in Python

Gradio is an open-source Python library that is used to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications.

With Gradio, you can quickly create a beautiful user interface around your machine learning models or data science workflow and let people "try it out" by dragging-and-dropping in their own images,
pasting text, recording their own voice, and interacting with your demo, all through the browser.

Gradio is useful for:

- **Demoing** your machine learning models for clients/collaborators/users/students.

- **Deploying** your models quickly with automatic shareable links and getting feedback on model performance.

- **Debugging** your model interactively during development using built-in manipulation and interpretation tools.
