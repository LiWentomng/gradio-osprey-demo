## Introduction

How well can an algorithm guess what you're drawing? A few years ago, Google released the **Quick Draw** dataset, which contains drawings made by humans of a variety of every objects. Researchers have used this dataset to train models to guess Pictionary-style drawings. 

Such models are perfect to use with Gradio's *sketchpad* input, so in this tutorial we will build a Pictionary web application using Gradio. We will be able to build the whole web application in Python, and will look like this (try drawing something!):

Let's get started! This guide covers how to build a pictionary app (step-by-step): 

1. [Set up the Sketch Recognition Model](#1-set-up-the-sketch-recognition-model)
2. [Define a `predict` function](#2-define-a-predict-function)
3. [Create a Gradio Interface](#3-create-a-gradio-interface)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started). To use the pretrained sketchpad model, also install `torch`.

## 1. Set up the Sketch Recognition Model

First, you will need a sketch recognition model. Since many researchers have already trained their own models on the Quick Draw dataset, we will use a pretrained model in this tutorial. Our model is a light 1.5 MB  model trained by Nate Raw, that [you can download here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/quickdraw/blob/main/pytorch_model.bin). 

If you are interested, here [is the code](https://github.com/nateraw/quickdraw-pytorch) that was used to train the model. We will simply load the pretrained model in PyTorch, as follows:

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, padding='same'),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2),
    nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, padding='same'),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2),
    nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 3, padding='same'),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2),
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(1152, 256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(256, len(LABELS)),
)
state_dict = torch.load('pytorch_model.bin',    map_location='cpu')
model.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)
model.eval()
```

## 2. Define a `predict` function

Next, you will need to define a function that takes in the *user input*, which in this case is a sketched image, and returns the prediction. The prediction should be returned as a dictionary whose keys are class name and values are confidence probabilities. We will load the class names from this [text file](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/quickdraw/blob/main/class_names.txt).

In the case of our pretrained model, it will look like this:

```python
from pathlib import Path

LABELS = Path('class_names.txt').read_text().splitlines()

def predict(img):
    x = torch.tensor(img, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0) / 255.
    with torch.no_grad():
        out = model(x)
    probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out[0], dim=0)
    values, indices = torch.topk(probabilities, 5)
    confidences = {LABELS[i]: v.item() for i, v in zip(indices, values)}
    return confidences
```

Let's break this down. The function takes one parameters:

* `img`: the input image as a `numpy` array

Then, the function converts the image to a PyTorch `tensor`, passes it through the model, and returns:

* `confidences`: the top five predictions, as a dictionary whose keys are class labels and whose values are confidence probabilities

## 3. Create a Gradio Interface

Now that we have our predictive function set up, we can create a Gradio Interface around it. 

In this case, the input component is a sketchpad. To create a sketchpad input, we can use the convenient string shortcut, `"sketchpad"` which creates a canvas for a user to draw on and handles the preprocessing to convert that to a numpy array. 

The output component will be a `"label"`, which displays the top labels in a nice form.

Finally, we'll add one more parameter, setting `live=True`, which allows our interface to run in real time, adjusting its predictions every time a user draws on the sketchpad. The code for Gradio looks like this:

```python
import gradio as gr

gr.Interface(fn=predict, 
             inputs="sketchpad",
             outputs="label",
             live=True).launch()
```

This produces the following interface, which you can try right here in your browser (try drawing something, like a "snake" or a "laptop"):

And you're done! That's all the code you need to build a Pictionary-style guessing app. Have fun and try to find some edge cases üßê
