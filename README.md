# Gradio-Osprey-Demo

This is the gradio used in demo of our [Osprey](https://github.com/CircleRadon/Osprey), [Pixel Understanding with Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10032). It is an extension to official [gradio-3.36.1](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), which supports drawing boxes on top of an image.

## Acknowledgement

The implementation is inspired by [gradio-box](https://github.com/ShoufaChen/gradio-box) and [gradio-app/gradio#3220](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/3220), with several modifications to `gradio-3.36.1`. Thank you for their open-source contributions!
