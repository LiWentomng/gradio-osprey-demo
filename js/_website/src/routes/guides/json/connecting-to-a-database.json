We will be\nconnecting to a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS but gradio is completely agnostic to the type of\ndatabase you are connecting to and where it's hosted. So as long as you can write python code to connect\nto your data, you can display it in a web UI with gradio \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## Overview \n    \nWe will be analyzing bike share data from Chicago. The data is hosted on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/cyclistic-bike-share?select=202203-divvy-tripdata.csv).\nOur goal is to create a dashboard that will enable our business stakeholders to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Are electric bikes more popular than regular bikes?\n2. What are the top 5 most popular departure bike stations?\n\nAt the end of this guide, we will have a functioning application that looks like this:\n\n<gradio-app space=\"gradio/chicago-bike-share-dashboard\"> </gradio-app>\n\n\n## Step 1 - Creating your database\n\nWe will be storing our data on a PostgreSQL hosted on Amazon's RDS service. Create an AWS account if you don't already have one\nand create a PostgreSQL database on the free tier. \n\n**Important**: If you plan to host this demo on HuggingFace Spaces, make sure database is on port **8080**. Spaces will\nblock all outgoing connections unless they are made to port 80, 443, or 8080 as noted [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#networking).\nRDS will not let you create a postgreSQL instance on ports 80 or 443.\n\nOnce your database is created, download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to your database.\nFor the sake of this demo, we will only upload March 2022 data.\n\n\n## Step 2.a - Write your ETL code\nWe will be querying our database for the total count of rides split by the type of bicycle (electric, standard, or docked).\nWe will also query for the total count of rides that depart from each station and take the top 5. \n\nWe will then take the result of our queries and visualize them in with matplotlib.\n\nWe will use the pandas [read_sql](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_sql.html)\nmethod to connect to the database. This requires the `psycopg2` library to be installed. \n\nIn order to connect to our database, we will specify the database username, password, and host as environment variables.\nThis will make our app more secure by avoiding storing sensitive information as plain text in our application files.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nDB_USER = os.getenv(\"DB_USER\")\nDB_PASSWORD = os.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\")\nDB_HOST = os.getenv(\"DB_HOST\")\nPORT = 8080\nDB_NAME = \"bikeshare\"\n\nconnection_string = f\"postgresql://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}?port={PORT}&dbname={DB_NAME}\"\n\ndef get_count_ride_type():\n    df = pd.read_sql(\n    \"\"\"\n        SELECT COUNT(ride_id) as n, rideable_type\n        FROM rides\n        GROUP BY rideable_type\n        ORDER BY n DESC\n    \"\"\",\n    con=connection_string\n    )\n    fig_m, ax = plt.subplots()\n    ax.bar(x=df['rideable_type'], height=df['n'])\n    ax.set_title(\"Number of rides by bycycle type\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Number of Rides\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Bicycle Type\")\n    return fig_m\n\n\ndef get_most_popular_stations():\n    \n    df = pd.read_sql(\n        \"\"\"\n    SELECT COUNT(ride_id) as n, MAX(start_station_name) as station\n    FROM RIDES\n    WHERE start_station_name is NOT NULL\n    GROUP BY start_station_id\n    ORDER BY n DESC\n    LIMIT 5\n    \"\"\",\n    con=connection_string\n    )\n    fig_m, ax = plt.subplots()\n    ax.bar(x=df['station'], height=df['n'])\n    ax.set_title(\"Most popular stations\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Number of Rides\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Station Name\")\n    ax.set_xticklabels(\n        df['station'], rotation=45, ha=\"right\", rotation_mode=\"anchor\"\n    )\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", labelsize=8)\n    fig_m.tight_layout()\n    return fig_m\n```\n\nIf you were to run our script locally, you could pass in your credentials as environment variables like so\n\n```bash\nDB_USER='username' DB_PASSWORD='password' DB_HOST='host' python app.py\n```\n\n\n## Step 2.c - Write your gradio app\nWe will display or matplotlib plots in two separate `gr.Plot` components displayed side by side using `gr.Row()`.\nBecause we have wrapped our function to fetch the data in a `demo.load()` event trigger,\nour demo will fetch the latest data **dynamically** from the database each time the web page loads. \ud83e\ude84\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        bike_type = gr.Plot()\n        station = gr.Plot()\n\n    demo.load(get_count_ride_type, inputs=None, outputs=bike_type)\n    demo.load(get_most_popular_stations, inputs=None, outputs=station)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n## Step 3 - Deployment\nIf you run the code above, your app will start running locally.\nYou can even get a temporary shareable link by passing the `share=True` parameter to `launch`.\n\nBut what if you want to a permanent deployment solution?\nLet's deploy our Gradio app to the free HuggingFace Spaces platform.\n\nIf you haven't used Spaces before, follow the previous guide [here](/using_hugging_face_integrations).\nYou will have to add the `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_HOST` variables as \"Repo Secrets\". You can do this in the \"Settings\" tab.\n\n![secrets](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/secrets.png?raw=true)\n\n## Conclusion\nCongratulations! You know how to connect your gradio app to a database hosted on the cloud! \u2601\ufe0f\n\nOur dashboard is now running on [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/chicago-bike-share-dashboard).\nThe complete code is [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/chicago-bike-share-dashboard/blob/main/app.py)\n \nAs you can see, gradio gives you the power to connect to your data wherever it lives and display however you want! \ud83d\udd25", "html": "<h1 id=\"connecting-to-a-database\">Connecting to a Database</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>This guide explains how you can use Gradio to connect your app to a database.
