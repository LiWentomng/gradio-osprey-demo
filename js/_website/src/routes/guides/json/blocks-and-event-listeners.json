Let's dive deeper. This guide will cover the how Blocks are structured, event listeners and their types, running events continuously, updating configurations, and using dictionaries vs lists. \n\n## Blocks Structure\n\nTake a look at the demo below.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    name = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output Box\")\n    greet_btn = gr.Button(\"Greet\")\n    greet_btn.click(fn=greet, inputs=name, outputs=output, api_name=\"greet\")\n   \n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/hello_blocks'></gradio-app>\n\n- First, note the `with gr.Blocks() as demo:` clause. The Blocks app code will be contained within this clause.\n- Next come the Components. These are the same Components used in `Interface`. However, instead of being passed to some constructor, Components are automatically added to the Blocks as they are created within the `with` clause.\n- Finally, the `click()` event listener. Event listeners define the data flow within the app. In the example above, the listener ties the two Textboxes together. The Textbox `name` acts as the input and Textbox `output` acts as the output to the `greet` method. This dataflow is triggered when the Button `greet_btn` is clicked. Like an Interface, an event listener can take multiple inputs or outputs.\n\n## Event Listeners and Interactivity\n\nIn the example above, you'll notice that you are able to edit Textbox `name`, but not Textbox `output`. This is because any Component that acts as an input to an event listener is made interactive. However, since Textbox `output` acts only as an output, it is not interactive. You can directly configure the interactivity of a Component with the `interactive=` keyword argument. \n\n```python\noutput = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\", interactive=True)\n```\n\n## Types of Event Listeners\n\nTake a look at the demo below:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef welcome(name):\n    return f\"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\n    \"\"\"\n    # Hello World!\n    Start typing below to see the output.\n    \"\"\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n    inp.change(welcome, inp, out)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_hello'></gradio-app>\n\nInstead of being triggered by a click, the `welcome` function is triggered by typing in the Textbox `inp`. This is due to the `change()` event listener. Different Components support different event listeners. For example, the `Video` Component supports a `play()` event listener, triggered when a user presses play. See the [Docs](http://gradio.app/docs#components) for the event listeners for each Component.\n\n## Multiple Data Flows\n\nA Blocks app is not limited to a single data flow the way Interfaces are. Take a look at the demo below:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef increase(num):\n    return num + 1\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    a = gr.Number(label=\"a\")\n    b = gr.Number(label=\"b\")\n    btoa = gr.Button(\"a > b\")\n    atob = gr.Button(\"b > a\")\n    atob.click(increase, a, b)\n    btoa.click(increase, b, a)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/reversible_flow'></gradio-app>\n\nNote that `num1` can act as input to `num2`, and also vice-versa! As your apps get more complex, you will have many data flows connecting various Components. \n\nHere's an example of a \"multi-step\" demo, where the output of one model (a speech-to-text model) gets fed into the next model (a sentiment classifier).\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\nasr = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\", \"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\nclassifier = pipeline(\"text-classification\")\n\n\ndef speech_to_text(speech):\n    text = asr(speech)[\"text\"]\n    return text\n\n\ndef text_to_sentiment(text):\n    return classifier(text)[0][\"label\"]\n\n\ndemo = gr.Blocks()\n\nwith demo:\n    audio_file = gr.Audio(type=\"filepath\")\n    text = gr.Textbox()\n    label = gr.Label()\n\n    b1 = gr.Button(\"Recognize Speech\")\n    b2 = gr.Button(\"Classify Sentiment\")\n\n    b1.click(speech_to_text, inputs=audio_file, outputs=text)\n    b2.click(text_to_sentiment, inputs=text, outputs=label)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_speech_text_sentiment'></gradio-app>\n\n## Function Input List vs Dict\n\nThe event listeners you've seen so far have a single input component. If you'd like to have multiple input components pass data to the function, you have two options on how the function can accept input component values:\n\n1. as a list of arguments, or\n2. as a single dictionary of values, keyed by the component\n\nLet's see an example of each:\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    a = gr.Number(label=\"a\")\n    b = gr.Number(label=\"b\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        add_btn = gr.Button(\"Add\")\n        sub_btn = gr.Button(\"Subtract\")\n    c = gr.Number(label=\"sum\")\n\n    def add(num1, num2):\n        return num1 + num2\n    add_btn.click(add, inputs=[a, b], outputs=c)\n\n    def sub(data):\n        return data[a] - data[b]\n    sub_btn.click(sub, inputs={a, b}, outputs=c)\n\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nBoth `add()` and `sub()` take `a` and `b` as inputs. However, the syntax is different between these listeners. \n\n1. To the `add_btn` listener, we pass the inputs as a list. The function `add()` takes each of these inputs as arguments. The value of `a` maps to the argument `num1`, and the value of `b` maps to the argument `num2`.\n2. To the `sub_btn` listener, we pass the inputs as a set (note the curly brackets!). The function `sub()` takes a single dictionary argument `data`, where the keys are the input components, and the values are the values of those components.\n\nIt is a matter of preference which syntax you prefer! For functions with many input components, option 2 may be easier to manage.\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/calculator_list_and_dict'></gradio-app>\n\n## Function Return List vs Dict\n\nSimilarly, you may return values for multiple output components either as:\n\n1. a list of values, or\n2. a dictionary keyed by the component\n\nLet's first see an example of (1), where we set the values of two output components by returning two values:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    food_box = gr.Number(value=10, label=\"Food Count\")\n    status_box = gr.Textbox()\n    def eat(food):\n        if food > 0:\n            return food - 1, \"full\"\n        else:\n            return 0, \"hungry\"\n    gr.Button(\"EAT\").click(\n        fn=eat, \n        inputs=food_box,\n        outputs=[food_box, status_box]\n    )\n```\n\nAbove, each return statement returns two values corresponding to `food_box` and `status_box`, respectively.\n\nInstead of returning a list of values corresponding to each output component in order, you can also return a dictionary, with the key corresponding to the output component and the value as the new value. This also allows you to skip updating some output components. \n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    food_box = gr.Number(value=10, label=\"Food Count\")\n    status_box = gr.Textbox()\n    def eat(food):\n        if food > 0:\n            return {food_box: food - 1, status_box: \"full\"}\n        else:\n            return {status_box: \"hungry\"}\n    gr.Button(\"EAT\").click(\n        fn=eat, \n        inputs=food_box,\n        outputs=[food_box, status_box]\n    )\n```\n\nNotice how when there is no food, we only update the `status_box` element. We skipped updating the `food_box` component.\n\nDictionary returns are helpful when an event listener affects many components on return, or conditionally affects outputs and not others.\n\nKeep in mind that with dictionary returns, we still need to specify the possible outputs in the event listener.\n\n## Updating Component Configurations\n\nThe return value of an event listener function is usually the updated value of the corresponding output Component. Sometimes we want to update the configuration of the Component as well, such as the visibility. In this case, we return a `gr.update()` object instead of just the update Component value.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef change_textbox(choice):\n    if choice == \"short\":\n        return gr.update(lines=2, visible=True, value=\"Short story: \")\n    elif choice == \"long\":\n        return gr.update(lines=8, visible=True, value=\"Long story...\")\n    else:\n        return gr.update(visible=False)\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    radio = gr.Radio(\n        [\"short\", \"long\", \"none\"], label=\"Essay Length to Write?\"\n    )\n    text = gr.Textbox(lines=2, interactive=True)\n    radio.change(fn=change_textbox, inputs=radio, outputs=text)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_essay_update'></gradio-app>\n\nSee how we can configure the Textbox itself through the `gr.update()` method. The `value=` argument can still be used to update the value along with Component configuration.\n\n## Running Events Consecutively\n\nYou can also run events consecutively by using the `then` method of an event listener. This will run an event after the previous event has finished running. This is useful for running events that update components in multiple steps. \n\nFor example, in the chatbot example below, we first update the chatbot with the user message immediately, and then update the chatbot with the computer response after a simulated delay.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport random\nimport time\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()\n    msg = gr.Textbox()\n    clear = gr.ClearButton([msg, chatbot])\n\n    def respond(message, chat_history):\n        bot_message = random.choice([\"How are you?\", \"I love you\", \"I'm very hungry\"])\n        chat_history.append((message, bot_message))\n        time.sleep(2)\n        return \"\", chat_history\n\n    msg.submit(respond, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot])\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_simple'></gradio-app>\n\nThe `.then()` method of an event listener executes the subsequent event regardless of whether the previous event raised any errors. If you'd like to  only run subsequent events if the previous event executed successfully, use the `.success()` method, which takes the same arguments as `.then()`.\n\n## Running Events Continuously\n\nYou can run events on a fixed schedule using the `every` parameter of the event listener. This will run the event\n`every` number of seconds while the client connection is open. If the connection is closed, the event will stop running after the following iteration.\nNote that this does not take into account the runtime of the event itself. So a function\nwith a 1 second runtime running with `every=5`, would actually run every 6 seconds.\n\nHere is an example of a sine curve that updates every second!\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport gradio as gr\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nplot_end = 2 * math.pi\n\n\ndef get_plot(period=1):\n    global plot_end\n    x = np.arange(plot_end - 2 * math.pi, plot_end, 0.02)\n    y = np.sin(2*math.pi*period * x)\n    fig = px.line(x=x, y=y)\n    plot_end += 2 * math.pi\n    if plot_end > 1000:\n        plot_end = 2 * math.pi\n    return fig\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.Markdown(\"Change the value of the slider to automatically update the plot\")\n            period = gr.Slider(label=\"Period of plot\", value=1, minimum=0, maximum=10, step=1)\n            plot = gr.Plot(label=\"Plot (updates every half second)\")\n\n    dep = demo.load(get_plot, None, plot, every=1)\n    period.change(get_plot, period, plot, every=1, cancels=[dep])\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.queue().launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/sine_curve'></gradio-app>\n\n## Gathering Event Data\n\nYou can gather specific data about an event by adding the associated event data class as a type hint to an argument in the event listener function. \n\nFor example, event data for `.select()` can be type hinted by a `gradio.SelectData` argument. This event is triggered when a user selects some part of the triggering component, and the event data includes information about what the user specifically selected. If a user selected a specific word in a `Textbox`, a specific image in a `Gallery`, or a specific cell in a `DataFrame`, the event data argument would contain information about the specific selection.\n\nIn the 2 player tic-tac-toe demo below, a user can select a cell in the `DataFrame` to make a move. The event data argument contains information about the specific cell that was selected. We can first check to see if the cell is empty, and then update the cell with the user's move. \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    turn = gr.Textbox(\"X\", interactive=False, label=\"Turn\")\n    board = gr.Dataframe(value=[[\"\", \"\", \"\"]] * 3, interactive=False, type=\"array\")\n\n    def place(board, turn, evt: gr.SelectData):\n        if evt.value:\n            return board, turn\n        board[evt.index[0]][evt.index[1]] = turn\n        turn = \"O\" if turn == \"X\" else \"X\"\n        return board, turn\n\n    board.select(place, [board, turn], [board, turn])\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/tictactoe'></gradio-app>", "html": "<h1 id=\"blocks-and-event-listeners\">Blocks and Event Listeners</h1>\n\n<p>We took a quick look at Blocks in the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control\">Quickstart</a>.

This is useful for running events that update components in multiple steps. </p>\n\n<p>For example, in the chatbot example below, we first update the chatbot with the user message immediately, and then update the chatbot with the computer response after a simulated delay.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\nimport random\nimport time\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()\n    msg = gr.Textbox()\n    clear = gr.ClearButton([msg, chatbot])\n\n    def respond(message, chat_history):\n        bot_message = random.choice([\"How are you?\", \"I love you\", \"I'm very hungry\"])\n        chat_history.append((message, bot_message))\n        time.sleep(2)\n        return \"\", chat_history\n\n    msg.submit(respond, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot])\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_simple'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<p>The <code>.then()</code> method of an event listener executes the subsequent event regardless of whether the previous event raised any errors. If you'd like to  only run subsequent events if the previous event executed successfully, use the <code>.success()</code> method, which takes the same arguments as <code>.then()</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"running-events-continuously\">Running Events Continuously</h2>\n\n<p>You can run events on a fixed schedule using the <code>every</code> parameter of the event listener. This will run the event\n<code>every</code> number of seconds while the client connection is open. If the connection is closed, the event will stop running after the following iteration.\nNote that this does not take into account the runtime of the event itself. So a function\nwith a 1 second runtime running with <code>every=5</code>, would actually run every 6 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of a sine curve that updates every second!</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import math\nimport gradio as gr\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nplot_end = 2 * math.pi\n\n\ndef get_plot(period=1):\n    global plot_end\n    x = np.arange(plot_end - 2 * math.pi, plot_end, 0.02)\n    y = np.sin(2*math.pi*period * x)\n    fig = px.line(x=x, y=y)\n    plot_end += 2 * math.pi\n    if plot_end > 1000:\n        plot_end = 2 * math.pi\n    return fig\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.Markdown(\"Change the value of the slider to automatically update the plot\")\n            period = gr.Slider(label=\"Period of plot\", value=1, minimum=0, maximum=10, step=1)\n            plot = gr.Plot(label=\"Plot (updates every half second)\")\n\n    dep = demo.load(get_plot, None, plot, every=1)\n    period.change(get_plot, period, plot, every=1, cancels=[dep])\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.queue().launch()\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/sine_curve'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gathering-event-data\">Gathering Event Data</h2>\n\n<p>You can gather specific data about an event by adding the associated event data class as a type hint to an argument in the event listener function. </p>\n\n<p>For example, event data for <code>.select()</code> can be type hinted by a <code>gradio.SelectData</code> argument. This event is triggered when a user selects some part of the triggering component, and the event data includes information about what the user specifically selected. If a user selected a specific word in a <code>Textbox</code>, a specific image in a <code>Gallery</code>, or a specific cell in a <code>DataFrame</code>, the event data argument would contain information about the specific selection.</p>\n\n<p>In the 2 player tic-tac-toe demo below, a user can select a cell in the <code>DataFrame</code> to make a move. The event data argument contains information about the specific cell that was selected. We can first check to see if the cell is empty, and then update the cell with the user's move. </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    turn = gr.Textbox(\"X\", interactive=False, label=\"Turn\")\n    board = gr.Dataframe(value=[[\"\", \"\", \"\"]] * 3, interactive=False, type=\"array\")\n\n    def place(board, turn, evt: gr.SelectData):\n        if evt.value:\n            return board, turn\n        board[evt.index[0]][evt.index[1]] = turn\n        turn = \"O\" if turn == \"X\" else \"X\"\n        return board, turn\n\n    board.select(place, [board, turn], [board, turn])\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/tictactoe'></gradio-app></p>\n", "tags": [], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/blocks-and-event-listeners/", "contributor": null}}
