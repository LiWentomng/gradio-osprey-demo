{"guides_by_category": [{"category": "Getting Started", "guides": [{"name": "quickstart", "category": "getting-started", "pretty_category": "Getting Started", "guide_index": 1, "absolute_index": 0, "pretty_name": "Quickstart", "content": "# Quickstart\n\n**Prerequisite**: Gradio requires Python 3.8 or higher, that's all!\n\n## What Does Gradio Do?\n\nOne of the *best ways to share* your machine learning model, API, or data science workflow with others is to create an **interactive app** that allows your users or colleagues to try out the demo in their browsers.\n\nGradio allows you to **build demos and share them, all in Python.** And usually in just a few lines of code! So let's get started.\n\n## Hello, World\n\nTo get Gradio running with a simple \"Hello, World\" example, follow these three steps:\n\n1\\. Install Gradio using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install gradio\n```\n\n2\\. Run the code below as a Python script or in a Jupyter Notebook (or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18ODkJvyxHutTN0P5APWyGFO_xwNcgHDZ?usp=sharing)):\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\"\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs=\"text\", outputs=\"text\")\n    \ndemo.launch()   \n```\n\nWe shorten the imported name to `gr` for better readability of code using Gradio. This is a widely adopted convention that you should follow so that anyone working with your code can easily understand it.\n\n3\\. The demo below will appear automatically within the Jupyter Notebook, or pop in a browser on [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860) if running from a script:\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/hello_world'></gradio-app>\n\nWhen developing locally, if you want to run the code as a Python script, you can use the Gradio CLI to launch the application **in reload mode**, which will provide seamless and fast development. Learn more about reloading in the [Auto-Reloading Guide](https://gradio.app/developing-faster-with-reload-mode/).\n\n```bash\ngradio app.py\n```\n\nNote: you can also do `python app.py`, but it won't provide the automatic reload mechanism.\n\n## The `Interface` Class\n\nYou'll notice that in order to make the demo, we created a `gr.Interface`. This `Interface` class can wrap any Python function with a user interface. In the example above, we saw a simple text-based function, but the function could be anything from music generator to a tax calculator to the prediction function of a pretrained machine learning model.\n\nThe core `Interface` class is initialized with three required parameters:\n\n- `fn`: the function to wrap a UI around\n- `inputs`: which component(s) to use for the input (e.g. `\"text\"`, `\"image\"` or `\"audio\"`)\n- `outputs`: which component(s) to use for the output (e.g. `\"text\"`, `\"image\"` or `\"label\"`)\n\nLet's take a closer look at these components used to provide input and output.\n\n## Components Attributes\n\nWe saw some simple `Textbox` components in the previous examples, but what if you want to change how the UI components look or behave?\n\nLet's say you want to customize the input text field \u2014 for example, you wanted it to be larger and have a text placeholder. If we use the actual class for `Textbox` instead of using the string shortcut, you have access to much more customizability through component attributes.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\"\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=greet,\n    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=2, placeholder=\"Name Here...\"),\n    outputs=\"text\",\n)\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/hello_world_2'></gradio-app>\n\n## Multiple Input and Output Components\n\nSuppose you had a more complex function, with multiple inputs and outputs. In the example below, we define a function that takes a string, boolean, and number, and returns a string and number. Take a look how you pass a list of input and output components.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name, is_morning, temperature):\n    salutation = \"Good morning\" if is_morning else \"Good evening\"\n    greeting = f\"{salutation} {name}. It is {temperature} degrees today\"\n    celsius = (temperature - 32) * 5 / 9\n    return greeting, round(celsius, 2)\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=greet,\n    inputs=[\"text\", \"checkbox\", gr.Slider(0, 100)],\n    outputs=[\"text\", \"number\"],\n)\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/hello_world_3'></gradio-app>\n\nYou simply wrap the components in a list. Each component in the `inputs` list corresponds to one of the parameters of the function, in order. Each component in the `outputs` list corresponds to one of the values returned by the function, again in order.\n\n## An Image Example\n\nGradio supports many types of components, such as `Image`, `DataFrame`, `Video`, or `Label`. Let's try an image-to-image function to get a feel for these!\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef sepia(input_img):\n    sepia_filter = np.array([\n        [0.393, 0.769, 0.189], \n        [0.349, 0.686, 0.168], \n        [0.272, 0.534, 0.131]\n    ])\n    sepia_img = input_img.dot(sepia_filter.T)\n    sepia_img /= sepia_img.max()\n    return sepia_img\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(sepia, gr.Image(shape=(200, 200)), \"image\")\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/sepia_filter'></gradio-app>\n\nWhen using the `Image` component as input, your function will receive a NumPy array with the shape `(height, width, 3)`, where the last dimension represents the RGB values. We'll return an image as well in the form of a NumPy array.\n\nYou can also set the datatype used by the component with the `type=` keyword argument. For example, if you wanted your function to take a file path to an image instead of a NumPy array, the input `Image` component could be written as:\n\n```python\ngr.Image(type=\"filepath\", shape=...)\n```\n\nAlso note that our input `Image` component comes with an edit button \ud83d\udd89, which allows for cropping and zooming into images. Manipulating images in this way can help reveal biases or hidden flaws in a machine learning model!\n\nYou can read more about the many components and how to use them in the [Gradio docs](https://gradio.app/docs).\n\n## Blocks: More Flexibility and Control\n\nGradio offers two classes to build apps:\n\n1\\. **Interface**, that provides a high-level abstraction for creating demos that we've been discussing so far.\n\n2\\. **Blocks**, a low-level API for designing web apps with more flexible layouts and data flows. Blocks allows you to do things like feature multiple data flows and demos, control where components appear on the page, handle complex data flows (e.g. outputs can serve as inputs to other functions), and update properties/visibility of components based on user interaction \u2014 still all in Python. If this customizability is what you need, try `Blocks` instead!\n\n## Hello, Blocks\n\nLet's take a look at a simple example. Note how the API here differs from `Interface`.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    name = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output Box\")\n    greet_btn = gr.Button(\"Greet\")\n    greet_btn.click(fn=greet, inputs=name, outputs=output, api_name=\"greet\")\n   \n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/hello_blocks'></gradio-app>\n\nThings to note:\n\n- `Blocks` are made with a `with` clause, and any component created inside this clause is automatically added to the app.\n- Components appear vertically in the app in the order they are created. (Later we will cover customizing layouts!)\n- A `Button` was created, and then a `click` event-listener was added to this button. The API for this should look familiar! Like an `Interface`, the `click` method takes a Python function, input components, and output components.\n\n## More Complexity\n\nHere's an app to give you a taste of what's possible with `Blocks`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport gradio as gr\n\n\ndef flip_text(x):\n    return x[::-1]\n\n\ndef flip_image(x):\n    return np.fliplr(x)\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"Flip text or image files using this demo.\")\n    with gr.Tab(\"Flip Text\"):\n        text_input = gr.Textbox()\n        text_output = gr.Textbox()\n        text_button = gr.Button(\"Flip\")\n    with gr.Tab(\"Flip Image\"):\n        with gr.Row():\n            image_input = gr.Image()\n            image_output = gr.Image()\n        image_button = gr.Button(\"Flip\")\n\n    with gr.Accordion(\"Open for More!\"):\n        gr.Markdown(\"Look at me...\")\n\n    text_button.click(flip_text, inputs=text_input, outputs=text_output)\n    image_button.click(flip_image, inputs=image_input, outputs=image_output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_flipper'></gradio-app>\n\nA lot more going on here! We'll cover how to create complex `Blocks` apps like this in the [building with blocks](https://gradio.app/building_with_blocks) section for you.\n\nCongrats, you're now familiar with the basics of Gradio! \ud83e\udd73 Go to our [next guide](https://gradio.app/key_features) to learn more about the key features of Gradio.\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"quickstart\">Quickstart</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Gradio requires Python 3.8 or higher, that's all!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-does-gradio-do\">What Does Gradio Do?</h2>\n\n<p>One of the <em>best ways to share</em> your machine learning model, API, or data science workflow with others is to create an <strong>interactive app</strong> that allows your users or colleagues to try out the demo in their browsers.</p>\n\n<p>Gradio allows you to <strong>build demos and share them, all in Python.</strong> And usually in just a few lines of code!

Here are Gradio's key features:\n\n1. [Adding example inputs](#example-inputs)\n2. [Passing custom error messages](#alerts)\n3. [Adding descriptive content](#descriptive-content)\n4. [Setting up flagging](#flagging)\n5. [Preprocessing and postprocessing](#preprocessing-and-postprocessing)\n6. [Styling demos](#styling)\n7. [Queuing users](#queuing)\n8. [Iterative outputs](#iterative-outputs)\n9. [Progress bars](#progress-bars)\n10. [Batch functions](#batch-functions)\n11. [Running on collaborative notebooks](#colab-notebooks)\n\n## Example Inputs\n\nYou can provide example data that a user can easily load into `Interface`. This can be helpful to demonstrate the types of inputs the model expects, as well as to provide a way to explore your dataset in conjunction with your model. To load example data, you can provide a **nested list** to the `examples=`  keyword argument of the Interface constructor. Each sublist within the outer list represents a data sample, and each element within the sublist represents an input for each input component. The format of example data for each component is specified in the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs#components).\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\n    if operation == \"add\":\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == \"subtract\":\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == \"multiply\":\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == \"divide\":\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise gr.Error(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n        return num1 / num2\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    calculator,\n    [\n        \"number\", \n        gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]),\n        \"number\"\n    ],\n    \"number\",\n    examples=[\n        [5, \"add\", 3],\n        [4, \"divide\", 2],\n        [-4, \"multiply\", 2.5],\n        [0, \"subtract\", 1.2],\n    ],\n    title=\"Toy Calculator\",\n    description=\"Here's a sample toy calculator. Allows you to calculate things like $2+2=4$\",\n)\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/calculator'></gradio-app>\n\nYou can load a large dataset into the examples to browse and interact with the dataset through Gradio. The examples will be automatically paginated (you can configure this through the `examples_per_page` argument of `Interface`).\n\nContinue learning about examples in the [More On Examples](https://gradio.app/more-on-examples) guide.\n\n## Alerts\n\nYou wish to pass custom error messages to the user. To do so, raise a `gr.Error(\"custom message\")` to display an error message. If you try to divide by zero in the calculator demo above, a popup modal will display the custom error message. Learn more about Error in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs#error). \n\nYou can also issue `gr.Warning(\"message\")` and `gr.Info(\"message\")` by having them as standalone lines in your function, which will immediately display modals while continuing the execution of your function. Queueing needs to be enabled for this to work. \n\nNote below how the `gr.Error` has to be raised, while the `gr.Warning` and `gr.Info` are single lines.\n\n```python\ndef start_process(name):\n    gr.Info(\"Starting process\")\n    if name is None:\n        gr.Warning(\"Name is empty\")\n    ...\n    if success == False:\n        raise gr.Error(\"Process failed\")\n```\n  \n## Descriptive Content\n\nIn the previous example, you may have noticed the `title=` and `description=` keyword arguments in the `Interface` constructor that helps users understand your app.\n\nThere are three arguments in the `Interface` constructor to specify where this content should go:\n\n* `title`: which accepts text and can display it at the very top of interface, and also becomes the page title.\n* `description`: which accepts text, markdown or HTML and places it right under the title.\n* `article`: which also accepts text, markdown or HTML and places it below the interface.\n\n![annotated](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/annotated.png?raw=true)\n\nIf you're using the `Blocks` API instead, you can insert text, markdown, or HTML anywhere using the `gr.Markdown(...)` or `gr.HTML(...)` components, with descriptive content inside the `Component` constructor.\n\nAnother useful keyword argument is `label=`, which is present in every `Component`. This modifies the label text at the top of each `Component`. You can also add the `info=` keyword argument to form elements like `Textbox` or `Radio` to provide further information on their usage.\n\n```python\ngr.Number(label='Age', info='In years, must be greater than 0')\n```\n\n## Flagging\n\nBy default, an `Interface` will have \"Flag\" button. When a user testing your `Interface` sees input with interesting output, such as erroneous or unexpected model behaviour, they can flag the input for you to review. Within the directory provided by the  `flagging_dir=`  argument to the `Interface` constructor, a CSV file will log the flagged inputs. If the interface involves file data, such as for Image and Audio components, folders will be created to store those flagged data as well.\n\nFor example, with the calculator interface shown above, we would have the flagged data stored in the flagged directory shown below:\n\n```directory\n+-- calculator.py\n+-- flagged/\n|   +-- logs.csv\n```\n\n*flagged/logs.csv*\n\n```csv\nnum1,operation,num2,Output\n5,add,7,12\n6,subtract,1.5,4.5\n```\n\nWith the sepia interface shown earlier, we would have the flagged data stored in the flagged directory shown below:\n\n```directory\n+-- sepia.py\n+-- flagged/\n|   +-- logs.csv\n|   +-- im/\n|   |   +-- 0.png\n|   |   +-- 1.png\n|   +-- Output/\n|   |   +-- 0.png\n|   |   +-- 1.png\n```\n\n*flagged/logs.csv*\n\n```csv\nim,Output\nim/0.png,Output/0.png\nim/1.png,Output/1.png\n```\n\nIf you wish for the user to provide a reason for flagging, you can pass a list of strings to the `flagging_options` argument of Interface. Users will have to select one of the strings when flagging, which will be saved as an additional column to the CSV.\n\n## Preprocessing and Postprocessing\n\n![](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/js/_website/src/assets/img/dataflow.svg?raw=true)\n\nAs you've seen, Gradio includes components that can handle a variety of different data types, such as images, audio, and video. Most components can be used both as inputs or outputs.\n\nWhen a component is used as an input, Gradio automatically handles the *preprocessing* needed to convert the data from a type sent by the user's browser (such as a base64 representation of a webcam snapshot) to a form that can be accepted by your function (such as a `numpy` array).\n\nSimilarly, when a component is used as an output, Gradio automatically handles the *postprocessing* needed to convert the data from what is returned by your function (such as a list of image paths) to a form that can be displayed in the user's browser (such as a `Gallery` of images in base64 format).\n\nYou can control the *preprocessing* using the parameters when constructing the image component. For example, here if you instantiate the `Image` component with the following parameters, it will convert the image to the `PIL` type and reshape it to be `(100, 100)` no matter the original size that it was submitted as:\n\n```py\nimg = gr.Image(shape=(100, 100), type=\"pil\")\n```\n\nIn contrast, here we keep the original size of the image, but invert the colors before converting it to a numpy array:\n\n```py\nimg = gr.Image(invert_colors=True, type=\"numpy\")\n```\n\nPostprocessing is a lot easier! Gradio automatically recognizes the format of the returned data (e.g. is the `Image` a `numpy` array or a `str` filepath?) and postprocesses it into a format that can be displayed by the browser.\n\nTake a look at the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs) to see all the preprocessing-related parameters for each Component.\n\n## Styling\n\nGradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the `theme=` kwarg to the `Interface` constructor. For example:\n\n```python\ndemo = gr.Interface(..., theme=gr.themes.Monochrome())\n```\n\nGradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from `gr.themes.*`. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the [Theming guide](https://gradio.app/guides/theming-guide) for more details.\n\nFor additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS to your app using the `css=` kwarg.\nThe base class for the Gradio app is `gradio-container`, so here's an example that changes the background color of the Gradio app:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Interface(css=\".gradio-container {background-color: red}\") as demo:\n    ...\n```\n\nSome components can be additionally styled through the `style()` method. For example:\n\n```python\nimg = gr.Image(\"lion.jpg\").style(height='24', rounded=False)\n```\n\nTake a look at the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs) to see all the styling options for each Component.\n\n## Queuing\n\nIf your app expects heavy traffic, use the `queue()` method to control processing rate. This will queue up calls so only a certain number of requests are processed at a single time. Queueing uses websockets, which also prevent network timeouts, so you should use queueing if the inference time of your function is long (> 1min).\n\nWith `Interface`:\n\n```python\ndemo = gr.Interface(...).queue()\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nWith `Blocks`:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    #...\ndemo.queue()\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nYou can control the number of requests processed at a single time as such:\n\n```python\ndemo.queue(concurrency_count=3)\n```\n\nSee the [Docs on queueing](/docs/#queue) on configuring other queuing parameters.\n\nTo specify only certain functions for queueing in Blocks:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo2:\n    num1 = gr.Number()\n    num2 = gr.Number()\n    output = gr.Number()\n    gr.Button(\"Add\").click(\n        lambda a, b: a + b, [num1, num2], output)\n    gr.Button(\"Multiply\").click(\n        lambda a, b: a * b, [num1, num2], output, queue=True)\ndemo2.launch()\n```\n\n## Iterative Outputs\n\nIn some cases, you may want to stream a sequence of outputs rather than show a single output at once. For example, you might have an image generation model and you want to show the image that is generated at each step, leading up to the final image. Or you might have a chatbot which streams its response one word at a time instead of returning it all at once.\n\nIn such cases, you can supply a **generator** function into Gradio instead of a regular function. Creating generators in Python is very simple: instead of a single `return` value, a function should `yield` a series of values instead. Usually the `yield` statement is put in some kind of loop. Here's an example of an generator that simply counts up to a given number:\n\n```python\ndef my_generator(x):\n    for i in range(x):\n        yield i\n```\n\nYou supply a generator into Gradio the same way as you would a regular function. For example, here's a a (fake) image generation model that generates noise for several steps before outputting an image:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\n# define core fn, which returns a generator {steps} times before returning the image\ndef fake_diffusion(steps):\n    for _ in range(steps):\n        time.sleep(1)\n        image = np.random.random((600, 600, 3))\n        yield image\n    image = \"https://gradio-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/diffusion_image/cute_dog.jpg\"\n    yield image\n\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(fake_diffusion, inputs=gr.Slider(1, 10, 3), outputs=\"image\")\n\n# define queue - required for generators\ndemo.queue()\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/fake_diffusion'></gradio-app>\n\nNote that we've added a `time.sleep(1)` in the iterator to create an artificial pause between steps so that you are able to observe the steps of the iterator (in a real image generation model, this probably wouldn't be necessary).\n\nSupplying a generator into Gradio **requires** you to enable queuing in the underlying Interface or Blocks (see the queuing section above).\n\n## Progress Bars\n\nGradio supports the ability to create a custom Progress Bars so that you have customizability and control over the progress update that you show to the user. In order to enable this, simply add an argument to your method that has a default value of a `gr.Progress` instance. Then you can update the progress levels by calling this instance directly with a float between 0 and 1, or using the `tqdm()` method of the `Progress` instance to track progress over an iterable, as shown below. Queueing must be enabled for progress updates.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport time\n\ndef slowly_reverse(word, progress=gr.Progress()):\n    progress(0, desc=\"Starting\")\n    time.sleep(1)\n    progress(0.05)\n    new_string = \"\"\n    for letter in progress.tqdm(word, desc=\"Reversing\"):\n        time.sleep(0.25)\n        new_string = letter + new_string\n    return new_string\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(slowly_reverse, gr.Text(), gr.Text())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.queue(concurrency_count=10).launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/progress_simple'></gradio-app>\n\nIf you use the `tqdm` library, you can even report progress updates automatically from any `tqdm.tqdm` that already exists within your function by setting the default argument as  `gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)`!\n\n## Batch Functions\n\nGradio supports the ability to pass *batch* functions. Batch functions are just\nfunctions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.\n\nFor example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of\nwords and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:\n\n```py\nimport time\n\ndef trim_words(words, lens):\n    trimmed_words = []\n    time.sleep(5)\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])        \n    return [trimmed_words]\n```\n\nThe advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio\nserver can automatically *batch* incoming requests and process them in parallel,\npotentially speeding up your demo. Here's what the Gradio code looks like (notice\nthe `batch=True` and `max_batch_size=16` -- both of these parameters can be passed\ninto event triggers or into the `Interface` class)\n\nWith `Interface`:\n\n```python\ndemo = gr.Interface(trim_words, [\"textbox\", \"number\"], [\"output\"], \n                    batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\ndemo.queue()\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nWith `Blocks`:\n\n```py\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        word = gr.Textbox(label=\"word\")\n        leng = gr.Number(label=\"leng\")\n        output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        run = gr.Button()\n\n    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\n\ndemo.queue()\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nIn the example above, 16 requests could be processed in parallel (for a total inference\ntime of 5 seconds), instead of each request being processed separately (for a total\ninference time of 80 seconds). Many Hugging Face `transformers` and `diffusers` models\nwork very naturally with Gradio's batch mode: here's [an example demo using diffusers to\ngenerate images in batches](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/diffusers_with_batching/run.py)\n\nNote: using batch functions with Gradio **requires** you to enable queuing in the underlying Interface or Blocks (see the queuing section above).\n\n\n## Colab Notebooks\n\n\nGradio is able to run anywhere you run Python, including local jupyter notebooks as well as collaborative notebooks, such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). In the case of local jupyter notebooks and Google Colab notbooks, Gradio runs on a local server which you can interact with in your browser. (Note: for Google Colab, this is accomplished by [service worker tunneling](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/docs/design/colab_integration.md), which requires cookies to be enabled in your browser.) For other remote notebooks, Gradio will also run on a server, but you will need to use [SSH tunneling](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh) to view the app in your local browser. Often a simpler options is to use Gradio's built-in public links, [discussed in the next Guide](https://gradio.app/guides/sharing-your-app/#sharing-demos).

This can be helpful to demonstrate the types of inputs the model expects, as well as to provide a way to explore your dataset in conjunction with your model. To load example data, you can provide a <strong>nested list</strong> to the <code>examples=</code>  keyword argument of the Interface constructor. Each sublist within the outer list represents a data sample, and each element within the sublist represents an input for each input component. The format of example data for each component is specified in the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/docs#components\">Docs</a>.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\n    if operation == \"add\":\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == \"subtract\":\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == \"multiply\":\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == \"divide\":\n        if num2 == 0:\n            raise gr.Error(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n        return num1 / num2\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    calculator,\n    [\n        \"number\", \n        gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]),\n        \"number\"\n    ],\n    \"number\",\n    examples=[\n        [5, \"add\", 3],\n        [4, \"divide\", 2],\n        [-4, \"multiply\", 2.5],\n        [0, \"subtract\", 1.2],\n    ],\n    title=\"Toy Calculator\",\n    description=\"Here's a sample toy calculator.

To do so, raise a <code>gr.Error(\"custom message\")</code> to display an error message. If you try to divide by zero in the calculator demo above, a popup modal will display the custom error message. Learn more about Error in the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/docs#error\">docs</a>. </p>\n\n<p>You can also issue <code>gr.Warning(\"message\")</code> and <code>gr.Info(\"message\")</code> by having them as standalone lines in your function, which will immediately display modals while continuing the execution of your function. Queueing needs to be enabled for this to work. </p>\n\n<p>Note below how the <code>gr.Error</code> has to be raised, while the <code>gr.Warning</code> and <code>gr.Info</code> are single lines.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>def start_process(name):\n    gr.Info(\"Starting process\")\n    if name is None:\n        gr.Warning(\"Name is empty\")\n    ...\n    if success == False:\n        raise gr.Error(\"Process failed\")\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"descriptive-content\">Descriptive Content</h2>\n\n<p>In the previous example, you may have noticed the <code>title=</code> and <code>description=</code> keyword arguments in the <code>Interface</code> constructor that helps users understand your app.</p>\n\n<p>There are three arguments in the <code>Interface</code> constructor to specify where this content should go:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>title</code>: which accepts text and can display it at the very top of interface, and also becomes the page title.</li>\n<li><code>description</code>: which accepts text, markdown or HTML and places it right under the title.</li>\n<li><code>article</code>: which also accepts text, markdown or HTML and places it below the interface.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/annotated.png?raw=true\" alt=\"annotated\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you're using the <code>Blocks</code> API instead, you can insert text, markdown, or HTML anywhere using the <code>gr.Markdown(...)</code> or <code>gr.HTML(...)</code> components, with descriptive content inside the <code>Component</code> constructor.</p>\n\n<p>Another useful keyword argument is <code>label=</code>, which is present in every <code>Component</code>. This modifies the label text at the top of each <code>Component</code>. You can also add the <code>info=</code> keyword argument to form elements like <code>Textbox</code> or <code>Radio</code> to provide further information on their usage.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>gr.Number(label='Age', info='In years, must be greater than 0')\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"flagging\">Flagging</h2>\n\n<p>By default, an <code>Interface</code> will have \"Flag\" button. When a user testing your <code>Interface</code> sees input with interesting output, such as erroneous or unexpected model behaviour, they can flag the input for you to review. Within the directory provided by the  <code>flagging_dir=</code>  argument to the <code>Interface</code> constructor, a CSV file will log the flagged inputs.

For example, here's a a (fake) image generation model that generates noise for several steps before outputting an image:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\n# define core fn, which returns a generator {steps} times before returning the image\ndef fake_diffusion(steps):\n    for _ in range(steps):\n        time.sleep(1)\n        image = np.random.random((600, 600, 3))\n        yield image\n    image = \"https://gradio-builds.s3.amazonaws.com/diffusion_image/cute_dog.jpg\"\n    yield image\n\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(fake_diffusion, inputs=gr.Slider(1, 10, 3), outputs=\"image\")\n\n# define queue - required for generators\ndemo.queue()\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/fake_diffusion'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<p>Note that we've added a <code>time.sleep(1)</code> in the iterator to create an artificial pause between steps so that you are able to observe the steps of the iterator (in a real image generation model, this probably wouldn't be necessary).</p>\n\n<p>Supplying a generator into Gradio <strong>requires</strong> you to enable queuing in the underlying Interface or Blocks (see the queuing section above).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"progress-bars\">Progress Bars</h2>\n\n<p>Gradio supports the ability to create a custom Progress Bars so that you have customizability and control over the progress update that you show to the user. In order to enable this, simply add an argument to your method that has a default value of a <code>gr.Progress</code> instance. Then you can update the progress levels by calling this instance directly with a float between 0 and 1, or using the <code>tqdm()</code> method of the <code>Progress</code> instance to track progress over an iterable, as shown below. Queueing must be enabled for progress updates.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\nimport time\n\ndef slowly_reverse(word, progress=gr.Progress()):\n    progress(0, desc=\"Starting\")\n    time.sleep(1)\n    progress(0.05)\n    new_string = \"\"\n    for letter in progress.tqdm(word, desc=\"Reversing\"):\n        time.sleep(0.25)\n        new_string = letter + new_string\n    return new_string\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(slowly_reverse, gr.Text(), gr.Text())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.queue(concurrency_count=10).launch()\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/progress_simple'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<p>If you use the <code>tqdm</code> library, you can even report progress updates automatically from any <code>tqdm.tqdm</code> that already exists within your function by setting the default argument as  <code>gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)</code>!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"batch-functions\">Batch Functions</h2>\n\n<p>Gradio supports the ability to pass <em>batch</em> functions. Batch functions are just\nfunctions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.</p>\n\n<p>For example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of\nwords and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>import time\n\ndef trim_words(words, lens):\n    trimmed_words = []\n    time.sleep(5)\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])        \n    return [trimmed_words]\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio\nserver can automatically <em>batch</em> incoming requests and process them in parallel,\npotentially speeding up your demo. Here's what the Gradio code looks like (notice\nthe <code>batch=True</code> and <code>max_batch_size=16</code> -- both of these parameters can be passed\ninto event triggers or into the <code>Interface</code> class)</p>\n\n<p>With <code>Interface</code>:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>demo = gr.Interface(trim_words, [\"textbox\", \"number\"], [\"output\"], \n                    batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\ndemo.queue()\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>With <code>Blocks</code>:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>import gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        word = gr.Textbox(label=\"word\")\n        leng = gr.Number(label=\"leng\")\n        output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        run = gr.Button()\n\n    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\n\ndemo.queue()\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>In the example above, 16 requests could be processed in parallel (for a total inference\ntime of 5 seconds), instead of each request being processed separately (for a total\ninference time of 80 seconds). Many Hugging Face <code>transformers</code> and <code>diffusers</code> models\nwork very naturally with Gradio's batch mode: here's <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/diffusers_with_batching/run.py\">an example demo using diffusers to\ngenerate images in batches</a></p>\n\n<p>Note: using batch functions with Gradio <strong>requires</strong> you to enable queuing in the underlying Interface or Blocks (see the queuing section above).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"colab-notebooks\">Colab Notebooks</h2>\n\n<p>Gradio is able to run anywhere you run Python, including local jupyter notebooks as well as collaborative notebooks, such as <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Google Colab</a>. In the case of local jupyter notebooks and Google Colab notbooks, Gradio runs on a local server which you can interact with in your browser. (Note: for Google Colab, this is accomplished by <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/docs/design/colab_integration.md\">service worker tunneling</a>, which requires cookies to be enabled in your browser.) For other remote notebooks, Gradio will also run on a server, but you will need to use <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh\">SSH tunneling</a> to view the app in your local browser. Often a simpler options is to use Gradio's built-in public links, <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/guides/sharing-your-app/#sharing-demos\">discussed in the next Guide</a>. </p>\n", "tags": [], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/key-features/", "contributor": null}, {"name": "sharing-your-app", "category": "getting-started", "pretty_category": "Getting Started", "guide_index": 3, "absolute_index": 2, "pretty_name": "Sharing Your App", "content": "# Sharing Your App\n\nHow to share your Gradio app: \n\n1.

[Security](#security-and-file-access)\n\n## Sharing Demos\n\nGradio demos can be easily shared publicly by setting `share=True` in the `launch()` method. Like this:\n\n```python\ndemo.launch(share=True)\n```\n\nThis generates a public, shareable link that you can send to anybody! When you send this link, the user on the other side can try out the model in their browser. Because the processing happens on your device (as long as your device stays on!), you don't have to worry about any packaging any dependencies. A share link usually looks something like this:  **XXXXX.gradio.app**. Although the link is served through a Gradio URL, we are only a proxy for your local server, and do not store any data sent through your app.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that these links are publicly accessible, meaning that anyone can use your model for prediction! Therefore, make sure not to expose any sensitive information through the functions you write, or allow any critical changes to occur on your device. If you set `share=False` (the default, except in colab notebooks), only a local link is created, which can be shared by  [port-forwarding](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example)  with specific users. \n\n![sharing](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/sharing.svg?raw=true)\n\nShare links expire after 72 hours.\n\n## Hosting on HF Spaces\n\nIf you'd like to have a permanent link to your Gradio demo on the internet, use Hugging Face Spaces. [Hugging Face Spaces](http://huggingface.co/spaces/) provides the infrastructure to permanently host your machine learning model for free! \n\nAfter you have [created a free Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/join), you have three methods to deploy your Gradio app to Hugging Face Spaces:\n\n1. From terminal: run `gradio deploy` in your app directory. The CLI will gather some basic metadata and then launch your app. To update your space, you can re-run this command or enable the Github Actions option to automatically update the Spaces on `git push`.\n\n2. From your browser: Drag and drop a folder containing your Gradio model and all related files [here](https://huggingface.co/new-space).\n\n3. Connect Spaces with your Git repository and Spaces will pull the Gradio app from there. See [this guide how to host on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-spaces) for more information. \n\n<video autoplay muted loop>\n  <source src=\"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/hf_demo.mp4?raw=true\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n</video>\n\nNote: Some components, like `gr.Image`, will display a \"Share\" button only on Spaces, so that users can share the generated output to the Discussions page of the Space easily. You can disable this with `show_share_button`, such as `gr.Image(show_share_button=False)`. \n\n![Image with show_share_button=True](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/share_icon.png?raw=true)\n\n## Embedding Hosted Spaces\n\nOnce you have hosted your app on Hugging Face Spaces (or on your own server), you may want to embed the demo on a different website, such as your blog or your portfolio. Embedding an interactive demo allows people to try out the machine learning model that you have built, without needing to download or install anything \u2014 right in their browser! The best part is that you can embed interactive demos even in static websites, such as GitHub pages.\n\nThere are two ways to embed your Gradio demos. You can find quick links to both options directly on the Hugging Face Space page, in the \"Embed this Space\" dropdown option:\n\n![Embed this Space dropdown option](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/embed_this_space.png?raw=true)\n\n### Embedding with Web Components\n\nWeb components typically offer a better experience to users than IFrames. Web components load lazily, meaning that they won't slow down the loading time of your website, and they automatically adjust their height based on the size of the Gradio app. \n\nTo embed with Web Components:\n\n1. Import the gradio JS library into into your site by adding the script below in your site (replace {GRADIO_VERSION} in the URL with the library version of Gradio you are using). \n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\"\nsrc=\"https://gradio.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/{GRADIO_VERSION}/gradio.js\">\n</script>\n```\n\n2. Add \n```html\n<gradio-app src=\"https://$your_space_host.hf.space\"></gradio-app>\n```\n\nelement where you want to place the app. Set the `src=` attribute to your Space's embed URL, which you can find in the \"Embed this Space\" button. For example:\n\n\n```html\n<gradio-app src=\"https://abidlabs-pytorch-image-classifier.hf.space\"></gradio-app>\n```\n\n<script>\nfetch(\"https://pypi.org/pypi/gradio/json\"\n).then(r => r.json()\n).then(obj => {\n    let v = obj.info.version;\n    content = document.querySelector('.prose');\n    content.innerHTML = content.innerHTML.replaceAll(\"{GRADIO_VERSION}\", v);\n});\n</script>\n\nYou can see examples of how web components look <a href=\"https://www.gradio.app\">on the Gradio landing page</a>.\n\nYou can also customize the appearance and behavior of your web component with attributes that you pass into the `<gradio-app>` tag:\n\n* `src`: as we've seen, the `src` attributes links to the URL of the hosted Gradio demo that you would like to embed\n* `space`: an optional shorthand if your Gradio demo is hosted on Hugging Face Space. Accepts a `username/space_name` instead of a full URL. Example: `gradio/Echocardiogram-Segmentation`. If this attribute attribute is provided, then `src` does not need to be provided.\n* `control_page_title`: a boolean designating whether the html title of the page should be set to the title of the Gradio app (by default `\"false\"`)\n* `initial_height`: the initial height of the web component while it is loading the Gradio app, (by default `\"300px\"`). Note that the final height is set based on the size of the Gradio app.\n* `container`: whether to show the border frame and information about where the Space is hosted (by default `\"true\"`)\n* `info`: whether to show just the information about where the Space is hosted underneath the embedded app (by default `\"true\"`)\n* `autoscroll`: whether to autoscroll to the output when prediction has finished (by default `\"false\"`)\n* `eager`: whether to load the Gradio app as soon as the page loads (by default `\"false\"`)\n* `theme_mode`: whether to use the `dark`, `light`, or default `system` theme mode (by default `\"system\"`)\n\nHere's an example of how to use these attributes to create a Gradio app that does not lazy load and has an initial height of 0px. \n\n```html\n<gradio-app space=\"gradio/Echocardiogram-Segmentation\" eager=\"true\" \ninitial_height=\"0px\"></gradio-app>\n```\n\n_Note: While Gradio's CSS will never impact the embedding page, the embedding page can affect the style of the embedded Gradio app. Make sure that any CSS in the parent page isn't so general that it could also apply to the embedded Gradio app and cause the styling to break. Element selectors such as `header { ... }` and `footer { ... }` will be the most likely to cause issues._\n\n### Embedding with IFrames\n\nTo embed with IFrames instead (if you cannot add javascript to your website, for example), add this element:\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://$your_space_host.hf.space\"></iframe>\n```\n\nAgain, you can find the `src=` attribute to your Space's embed URL, which you can find in the \"Embed this Space\" button.\n\nNote: if you use IFrames, you'll probably want to add a fixed `height` attribute and set `style=\"border:0;\"` to remove the boreder. In addition, if your app requires permissions such as access to the webcam or the microphone, you'll need to provide that as well using the `allow` attribute.\n\n## API Page\n\nYou can use almost any Gradio app as an API! In the footer of a Gradio app [like this one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/hello_world), you'll see a \"Use via API\" link.  \n\n![Use via API](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/api3.gif)\n\nThis is a page that lists the endpoints that can be used to query the Gradio app, via our supported clients: either [the Python client](https://gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client/), or [the JavaScript client](https://gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-js-client/). For each endpoint, Gradio automatically generates the parameters and their types, as well as example inputs.\n\nThe endpoints are automatically created when you launch a Gradio `Interface`. If you are using Gradio `Blocks`, you can also set up a Gradio API page, though we recommend that you explicitly name each event listener, such as\n\n```python\nbtn.click(add, [num1, num2], output, api_name=\"addition\")\n```\n\nThis will add and document the endpoint `/api/addition/` to the automatically generated API page. Otherwise, your API endpoints will appear as \"unnamed\" endpoints. \n\n*Note*: For Gradio apps in which [queueing is enabled](https://gradio.app/guides/key-features#queuing), users can bypass the queue if they make a POST request to your API endpoint. To disable this behavior, set `api_open=False` in the `queue()` method. To disable the API page altogether, set `show_api=False` in `.launch()`.\n\n## Authentication\n\nYou may wish to put an authentication page in front of your app to limit who can open your app. With the `auth=` keyword argument in the `launch()` method, you can provide a tuple with a username and password, or a  list of acceptable username/password tuples;  Here's an example that provides password-based authentication for a single user named \"admin\":\n\n```python\ndemo.launch(auth=(\"admin\", \"pass1234\"))\n```\n\nFor more complex authentication handling, you can even pass a function that takes a username and password as arguments, and returns True to allow authentication, False otherwise. This can be used for, among other things, making requests to 3rd-party authentication services.\n\nHere's an example of a function that accepts any login where the username and password are the same:\n\n```python\ndef same_auth(username, password):\n    return username == password\ndemo.launch(auth=same_auth)\n```\n\nFor authentication to work properly, third party cookies must be enabled in your browser.\nThis is not the case by default for Safari, Chrome Incognito Mode.\n\n## Accessing the Network Request Directly\n\nWhen a user makes a prediction to your app, you may need the underlying network request, in order to get the request headers (e.g. for advanced authentication), log the client's IP address, or for other reasons. Gradio supports this in a similar manner to FastAPI: simply add a function parameter whose type hint is `gr.Request` and Gradio will pass in the network request as that parameter. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef echo(name, request: gr.Request):\n    if request:\n        print(\"Request headers dictionary:\", request.headers)\n        print(\"IP address:\", request.client.host)\n    return name\n\nio = gr.Interface(echo, \"textbox\", \"textbox\").launch()\n```\n\nNote: if your function is called directly instead of through the UI (this happens, for \nexample, when examples are cached), then `request` will be `None`. You should handle\nthis case explicitly to ensure that your app does not throw any errors. That is why\nwe have the explicit check `if request`.\n\n## Mounting Within Another FastAPI App\n\nIn some cases, you might have an existing FastAPI app, and you'd like to add a path for a Gradio demo.\nYou can easily do this with `gradio.mount_gradio_app()`.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nimport gradio as gr\n\nCUSTOM_PATH = \"/gradio\"\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_main():\n    return {\"message\": \"This is your main app\"}\n\n\nio = gr.Interface(lambda x: \"Hello, \" + x + \"!\", \"textbox\", \"textbox\")\napp = gr.mount_gradio_app(app, io, path=CUSTOM_PATH)\n\n\n# Run this from the terminal as you would normally start a FastAPI app: `uvicorn run:app`\n# and navigate to http://localhost:8000/gradio in your browser.\n\n```\n\nNote that this approach also allows you run your Gradio apps on custom paths (`http://localhost:8000/gradio` in the example above).\n\n## Security and File Access\n\nSharing your Gradio app with others (by hosting it on Spaces, on your own server, or through temporary share links) **exposes** certain files on the host machine to users of your Gradio app. \n\nIn particular, Gradio apps ALLOW users to access to three kinds of files:\n\n* **Files in the same directory (or a subdirectory) of where the Gradio script is launched from.** For example, if the path to your gradio scripts is `/home/usr/scripts/project/app.py` and you launch it from `/home/usr/scripts/project/`, then users of your shared Gradio app will be able to access any files inside `/home/usr/scripts/project/`. This is done so that you can easily reference these files in your Gradio app (e.g. for your app's `examples`).\n\n* **Temporary files created by Gradio.** These are files that are created by Gradio as part of running your prediction function. For example, if your prediction function returns a video file, then Gradio will save that video to a temporary file and then send the path to the temporary file to the front end. You can customize the location of temporary files created by Gradio by setting the environment variable `GRADIO_TEMP_DIR` to an absolute path, such as `/home/usr/scripts/project/temp/`.\n\n* **Files that you explicitly allow via the `allowed_paths` parameter in `launch()`**. This parameter  allows you to pass in a list of additional directories or exact filepaths you'd like to allow users to have access to. (By default, this parameter is an empty list).\n\nGradio DOES NOT ALLOW access to:\n\n* **Dotfiles** (any files whose name begins with `'.'`) or any files that are contained in any directory whose name begins with `'.'`\n\n* **Files that you explicitly allow via the `blocked_paths` parameter in `launch()`**. You can pass in a list of additional directories or exact filepaths to the `blocked_paths` parameter in `launch()`. This parameter takes precedence over the files that Gradio exposes by default or by the `allowed_paths`.\n\n* **Any other paths on the host machine**. Users should NOT be able to access other arbitrary paths on the host. \n\nPlease make sure you are running the latest version of `gradio` for these security settings to apply.

For example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-html'><gradio-app src=\"https://abidlabs-pytorch-image-classifier.hf.space\"></gradio-app>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<script>\nfetch(\"https://pypi.org/pypi/gradio/json\"\n).then(r => r.json()\n).then(obj => {\n    let v = obj.info.version;\n    content = document.querySelector('.prose');\n    content.innerHTML = content.innerHTML.replaceAll(\"{GRADIO_VERSION}\", v);\n});\n</script>\n\n<p>You can see examples of how web components look <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gradio.app\">on the Gradio landing page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also customize the appearance and behavior of your web component with attributes that you pass into the <code>&lt;gradio-app&gt;</code> tag:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>src</code>: as we've seen, the <code>src</code> attributes links to the URL of the hosted Gradio demo that you would like to embed</li>\n<li><code>space</code>: an optional shorthand if your Gradio demo is hosted on Hugging Face Space. Accepts a <code>username/space_name</code> instead of a full URL. Example: <code>gradio/Echocardiogram-Segmentation</code>. If this attribute attribute is provided, then <code>src</code> does not need to be provided.</li>\n<li><code>control_page_title</code>: a boolean designating whether the html title of the page should be set to the title of the Gradio app (by default <code>\"false\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>initial_height</code>: the initial height of the web component while it is loading the Gradio app, (by default <code>\"300px\"</code>). Note that the final height is set based on the size of the Gradio app.</li>\n<li><code>container</code>: whether to show the border frame and information about where the Space is hosted (by default <code>\"true\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>info</code>: whether to show just the information about where the Space is hosted underneath the embedded app (by default <code>\"true\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>autoscroll</code>: whether to autoscroll to the output when prediction has finished (by default <code>\"false\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>eager</code>: whether to load the Gradio app as soon as the page loads (by default <code>\"false\"</code>)</li>\n<li><code>theme_mode</code>: whether to use the <code>dark</code>, <code>light</code>, or default <code>system</code> theme mode (by default <code>\"system\"</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's an example of how to use these attributes to create a Gradio app that does not lazy load and has an initial height of 0px. </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-html'><gradio-app space=\"gradio/Echocardiogram-Segmentation\" eager=\"true\" \ninitial_height=\"0px\"></gradio-app>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><em>Note: While Gradio's CSS will never impact the embedding page, the embedding page can affect the style of the embedded Gradio app. Make sure that any CSS in the parent page isn't so general that it could also apply to the embedded Gradio app and cause the styling to break. Element selectors such as <code>header { ... }</code> and <code>footer { ... }</code> will be the most likely to cause issues.</em></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"embedding-with-iframes\">Embedding with IFrames</h3>\n\n<p>To embed with IFrames instead (if you cannot add javascript to your website, for example), add this element:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-html'><iframe src=\"https://$your_space_host.hf.space\"></iframe>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Again, you can find the <code>src=</code> attribute to your Space's embed URL, which you can find in the \"Embed this Space\" button.</p>\n\n<p>Note: if you use IFrames, you'll probably want to add a fixed <code>height</code> attribute and set <code>style=\"border:0;\"</code> to remove the boreder. In addition, if your app requires permissions such as access to the webcam or the microphone, you'll need to provide that as well using the <code>allow</code> attribute.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"api-page\">API Page</h2>\n\n<p>You can use almost any Gradio app as an API! In the footer of a Gradio app <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/hello_world\">like this one</a>, you'll see a \"Use via API\" link.  </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/api3.gif\" alt=\"Use via API\" /></p>\n\n<p>This is a page that lists the endpoints that can be used to query the Gradio app, via our supported clients: either <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client/\">the Python client</a>, or <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/guides/getting-started-with-the-js-client/\">the JavaScript client</a>. For each endpoint, Gradio automatically generates the parameters and their types, as well as example inputs.</p>\n\n<p>The endpoints are automatically created when you launch a Gradio <code>Interface</code>. If you are using Gradio <code>Blocks</code>, you can also set up a Gradio API page, though we recommend that you explicitly name each event listener, such as</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>btn.click(add, [num1, num2], output, api_name=\"addition\")\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This will add and document the endpoint <code>/api/addition/</code> to the automatically generated API page. Otherwise, your API endpoints will appear as \"unnamed\" endpoints. </p>\n\n<p><em>Note</em>: For Gradio apps in which <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/guides/key-features#queuing\">queueing is enabled</a>, users can bypass the queue if they make a POST request to your API endpoint. To disable this behavior, set <code>api_open=False</code> in the <code>queue()</code> method. To disable the API page altogether, set <code>show_api=False</code> in <code>.launch()</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"authentication\">Authentication</h2>\n\n<p>You may wish to put an authentication page in front of your app to limit who can open your app. With the <code>auth=</code> keyword argument in the <code>launch()</code> method, you can provide a tuple with a username and password, or a  list of acceptable username/password tuples;  Here's an example that provides password-based authentication for a single user named \"admin\":</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>demo.launch(auth=(\"admin\", \"pass1234\"))\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>For more complex authentication handling, you can even pass a function that takes a username and password as arguments, and returns True to allow authentication, False otherwise. This can be used for, among other things, making requests to 3rd-party authentication services.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of a function that accepts any login where the username and password are the same:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>def same_auth(username, password):\n    return username == password\ndemo.launch(auth=same_auth)\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>For authentication to work properly, third party cookies must be enabled in your browser.\nThis is not the case by default for Safari, Chrome Incognito Mode.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accessing-the-network-request-directly\">Accessing the Network Request Directly</h2>\n\n<p>When a user makes a prediction to your app, you may need the underlying network request, in order to get the request headers (e.g. for advanced authentication), log the client's IP address, or for other reasons. Gradio supports this in a similar manner to FastAPI: simply add a function parameter whose type hint is <code>gr.Request</code> and Gradio will pass in the network request as that parameter. Here is an example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ndef echo(name, request: gr.Request):\n    if request:\n        print(\"Request headers dictionary:\", request.headers)\n        print(\"IP address:\", request.client.host)\n    return name\n\nio = gr.Interface(echo, \"textbox\", \"textbox\").launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Note: if your function is called directly instead of through the UI (this happens, for \nexample, when examples are cached), then <code>request</code> will be <code>None</code>. You should handle\nthis case explicitly to ensure that your app does not throw any errors. That is why\nwe have the explicit check <code>if request</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mounting-within-another-fastapi-app\">Mounting Within Another FastAPI App</h2>\n\n<p>In some cases, you might have an existing FastAPI app, and you'd like to add a path for a Gradio demo.\nYou can easily do this with <code>gradio.mount_gradio_app()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a complete example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from fastapi import FastAPI\nimport gradio as gr\n\nCUSTOM_PATH = \"/gradio\"\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_main():\n    return {\"message\": \"This is your main app\"}\n\n\nio = gr.Interface(lambda x: \"Hello, \" + x + \"!\", \"textbox\", \"textbox\")\napp = gr.mount_gradio_app(app, io, path=CUSTOM_PATH)\n\n\n# Run this from the terminal as you would normally start a FastAPI app: `uvicorn run:app`\n# and navigate to http://localhost:8000/gradio in your browser.\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Note that this approach also allows you run your Gradio apps on custom paths (<code>http://localhost:8000/gradio</code> in the example above).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security-and-file-access\">Security and File Access</h2>\n\n<p>Sharing your Gradio app with others (by hosting it on Spaces, on your own server, or through temporary share links) <strong>exposes</strong> certain files on the host machine to users of your Gradio app. </p>\n\n<p>In particular, Gradio apps ALLOW users to access to three kinds of files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Files in the same directory (or a subdirectory) of where the Gradio script is launched from.</strong> For example, if the path to your gradio scripts is <code>/home/usr/scripts/project/app.py</code> and you launch it from <code>/home/usr/scripts/project/</code>, then users of your shared Gradio app will be able to access any files inside <code>/home/usr/scripts/project/</code>. This is done so that you can easily reference these files in your Gradio app (e.g. for your app's <code>examples</code>).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Temporary files created by Gradio.</strong> These are files that are created by Gradio as part of running your prediction function. For example, if your prediction function returns a video file, then Gradio will save that video to a temporary file and then send the path to the temporary file to the front end. You can customize the location of temporary files created by Gradio by setting the environment variable <code>GRADIO_TEMP_DIR</code> to an absolute path, such as <code>/home/usr/scripts/project/temp/</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Files that you explicitly allow via the <code>allowed_paths</code> parameter in <code>launch()</code></strong>. This parameter  allows you to pass in a list of additional directories or exact filepaths you'd like to allow users to have access to. (By default, this parameter is an empty list).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Gradio DOES NOT ALLOW access to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Dotfiles</strong> (any files whose name begins with <code>'.'</code>) or any files that are contained in any directory whose name begins with <code>'.'</code></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Files that you explicitly allow via the <code>blocked_paths</code> parameter in <code>launch()</code></strong>. You can pass in a list of additional directories or exact filepaths to the <code>blocked_paths</code> parameter in <code>launch()</code>. This parameter takes precedence over the files that Gradio exposes by default or by the <code>allowed_paths</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Any other paths on the host machine</strong>. Users should NOT be able to access other arbitrary paths on the host. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please make sure you are running the latest version of <code>gradio</code> for these security settings to apply. </p>\n", "tags": [], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/sharing-your-app/", "contributor": null}]}, {"category": "Building Interfaces", "guides": [{"name": "interface-state", "category": "building-interfaces", "pretty_category": "Building Interfaces", "guide_index": 1, "absolute_index": 3, "pretty_name": "Interface State", "content": "# Interface State\n\nThis guide covers how State is handled in Gradio. Learn the difference between Global and Session states, and how to use both.\n\n## Global State\n\nYour function may use data that persists beyond a single function call. If the data is something accessible to all function calls and all users, you can create a variable outside the function call and access it inside the function. For example, you may load a large model outside the function and use it inside the function so that every function call does not need to reload the model. \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nscores = []\n\ndef track_score(score):\n    scores.append(score)\n    top_scores = sorted(scores, reverse=True)[:3]\n    return top_scores\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    track_score, \n    gr.Number(label=\"Score\"), \n    gr.JSON(label=\"Top Scores\")\n)\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nIn the code above, the `scores` array is shared between all users. If multiple users are accessing this demo, their scores will all be added to the same list, and the returned top 3 scores will be collected from this shared reference. \n\n## Session State\n\nAnother type of data persistence Gradio supports is session **state**, where data persists across multiple submits within a page session. However, data is *not* shared between different users of your model. To store data in a session state, you need to do three things:\n\n1. Pass in an extra parameter into your function, which represents the state of the interface.\n2. At the end of the function, return the updated value of the state as an extra return value.\n3. Add the `'state'` input and `'state'` output components when creating your `Interface`\n\nA chatbot is an example where you would need session state - you want access to a users previous submissions, but you cannot store chat history in a global variable, because then chat history would get jumbled between different users. \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/DialoGPT-medium\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/DialoGPT-medium\")\n\n\ndef user(message, history):\n    return \"\", history + [[message, None]]\n\n\ndef bot(history):\n    user_message = history[-1][0]\n    new_user_input_ids = tokenizer.encode(\n        user_message + tokenizer.eos_token, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n    )\n\n    # append the new user input tokens to the chat history\n    bot_input_ids = torch.cat([torch.LongTensor([]), new_user_input_ids], dim=-1)\n\n    # generate a response\n    response = model.generate(\n        bot_input_ids, max_length=1000, pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id\n    ).tolist()\n\n    # convert the tokens to text, and then split the responses into lines\n    response = tokenizer.decode(response[0]).split(\"<|endoftext|>\")\n    response = [\n        (response[i], response[i + 1]) for i in range(0, len(response) - 1, 2)\n    ]  # convert to tuples of list\n    history[-1] = response[0]\n    return history\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()\n    msg = gr.Textbox()\n    clear = gr.Button(\"Clear\")\n\n    msg.submit(user, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot], queue=False).then(\n        bot, chatbot, chatbot\n    )\n    clear.click(lambda: None, None, chatbot, queue=False)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_dialogpt'></gradio-app>\n\nNotice how the state persists across submits within each page, but if you load this demo in another tab (or refresh the page), the demos will not share chat history. \n\nThe default value of `state` is None. If you pass a default value to the state parameter of the function, it is used as the default value of the state instead.

If your Interface takes only a single file-type input, e.g. an image classifier, you can simply pass a directory filepath to the `examples=` argument, and the `Interface` will load the images in the directory as examples. \nIn the case of multiple inputs, this directory must\ncontain a log.csv file with the example values.\nIn the context of the calculator demo, we can set  `examples='/demo/calculator/examples'` and in that directory we include the following `log.csv` file:\n```csv\nnum,operation,num2\n5,\"add\",3\n4,\"divide\",2\n5,\"multiply\",3\n```\n\nThis can be helpful when browsing flagged data. Simply point to the flagged directory and the `Interface` will load the examples from the flagged data.\n\n### Providing Partial Examples\n\nSometimes your app has many input components, but you would only like to provide examples for a subset of them. In order to exclude some inputs from the examples, pass `None` for all data samples corresponding to those particular components.\n\n## Caching examples\n\nYou may wish to provide some cached examples of your model for users to quickly try out, in case your model takes a while to run normally.\nIf `cache_examples=True`, the `Interface` will run all of your examples through your app and save the outputs when you call the `launch()` method. This data will be saved in a directory called `gradio_cached_examples`. \n\nWhenever a user clicks on an example, the output will automatically be populated in the app now, using data from this cached directory instead of actually running the function. This is useful so users can quickly try out your model without adding any load!  \n\nKeep in mind once the cache is generated, it will not be updated in future launches.

This guide covers all the advanced features: Using [Interpretation](https://gradio.app/docs#interpretation), custom styling, loading from the [Hugging Face Hub](https://hf.co), and using [Parallel](https://gradio.app/docs#parallel) and [Series](https://gradio.app/docs#series). \n\n## Interpreting your Predictions\n\nMost models are black boxes such that the internal logic of the function is hidden from the end user. To encourage transparency, we've made it very easy to add interpretation to your model by  simply setting the `interpretation` keyword in the `Interface` class to `default`. This allows your users to understand what parts of the input are responsible for the output. Take a look at the simple interface below which shows an image classifier that also includes interpretation:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\ninception_net = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2()  # load the model\n\n# Download human-readable labels for ImageNet.\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://git.io/JJkYN\")\nlabels = response.text.split(\"\\n\")\n\n\ndef classify_image(inp):\n    inp = inp.reshape((-1, 224, 224, 3))\n    inp = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(inp)\n    prediction = inception_net.predict(inp).flatten()\n    return {labels[i]: float(prediction[i]) for i in range(1000)}\n\n\nimage = gr.Image(shape=(224, 224))\nlabel = gr.Label(num_top_classes=3)\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=classify_image, inputs=image, outputs=label, interpretation=\"default\"\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\n\nIn addition to `default`, Gradio also includes [Shapley-based interpretation](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shap.html), which provides more accurate interpretations, albeit usually with a slower runtime. To use this, simply set the `interpretation` parameter to `\"shap\"` (note: also make sure the python package `shap` is installed). Optionally, you can modify the `num_shap` parameter, which controls the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime (increasing this value generally increases accuracy). Here is an example:\n\n```python\ngr.Interface(fn=classify_image,\n            inputs=image, \n            outputs=label, \n            interpretation=\"shap\", \n            num_shap=5).launch()\n```\n\nThis will work for any function, even if internally, the model is a complex neural network or some other black box. If you use Gradio's `default` or `shap` interpretation, the output component must be a `Label`. All common input components are supported. Here is an example with text input.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nmale_words, female_words = [\"he\", \"his\", \"him\"], [\"she\", \"hers\", \"her\"]\n\n\ndef gender_of_sentence(sentence):\n    male_count = len([word for word in sentence.split() if word.lower() in male_words])\n    female_count = len(\n        [word for word in sentence.split() if word.lower() in female_words]\n    )\n    total = max(male_count + female_count, 1)\n    return {\"male\": male_count / total, \"female\": female_count / total}\n\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=gender_of_sentence,\n    inputs=gr.Textbox(value=\"She went to his house to get her keys.\"),\n    outputs=\"label\",\n    interpretation=\"default\",\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\nSo what is happening under the hood? With these interpretation methods, Gradio runs the prediction multiple times with modified versions of the input. Based on the results, you'll see that the interface automatically highlights the parts of the text (or image, etc.) that contributed increased the likelihood of the class as red. The intensity of color corresponds to the importance of that part of the input. The parts that decrease the class confidence are highlighted blue.\n\nYou can also write your own interpretation function. The demo below adds custom interpretation to the previous demo. This function will take the same inputs as the main wrapped function. The output of this interpretation function will be used to highlight the input of each input component - therefore the function must return a list where the number of elements corresponds to the number of input components. To see the format for interpretation for each input component, check the Docs.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\nmale_words, female_words = [\"he\", \"his\", \"him\"], [\"she\", \"hers\", \"her\"]\n\n\ndef gender_of_sentence(sentence):\n    male_count = len([word for word in sentence.split() if word.lower() in male_words])\n    female_count = len(\n        [word for word in sentence.split() if word.lower() in female_words]\n    )\n    total = max(male_count + female_count, 1)\n    return {\"male\": male_count / total, \"female\": female_count / total}\n\n\n# Number of arguments to interpretation function must\n# match number of inputs to prediction function\ndef interpret_gender(sentence):\n    result = gender_of_sentence(sentence)\n    is_male = result[\"male\"] > result[\"female\"]\n    interpretation = []\n    for word in re.split(\"( )\", sentence):\n        score = 0\n        token = word.lower()\n        if (is_male and token in male_words) or (not is_male and token in female_words):\n            score = 1\n        elif (is_male and token in female_words) or (\n            not is_male and token in male_words\n        ):\n            score = -1\n        interpretation.append((word, score))\n    # Output must be a list of lists containing the same number of elements as inputs\n    # Each element corresponds to the interpretation scores for the given input\n    return [interpretation]\n\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=gender_of_sentence,\n    inputs=gr.Textbox(value=\"She went to his house to get her keys.\"),\n    outputs=\"label\",\n    interpretation=interpret_gender,\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\nLearn more about Interpretation in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs#interpretation). \n\n## Custom Styling\n\nIf you'd like to have more fine-grained control over any aspect of your demo, you can also write your own css or pass in a filepath to a css file, with the `css` parameter of the `Interface` class.\n\n```python\ngr.Interface(..., css=\"body {background-color: red}\")\n```\n\nIf you'd like to reference external files in your css, preface the file path (which can be a relative or absolute path) with `\"file=\"`, for example:\n\n```python\ngr.Interface(..., css=\"body {background-image: url('file=clouds.jpg')}\")\n```\n\n**Warning**: Custom CSS is *not* guaranteed to work across Gradio versions as the Gradio HTML DOM may change. We recommend using custom CSS sparingly and instead using [Themes](/guides/theming-guide/) whenever possible. \n\n## Loading Hugging Face Models and Spaces\n\nGradio integrates nicely with the [Hugging Face Hub](https://hf.co), allowing you to load models and Spaces with just one line of code. To use this, simply use the `load()` method in the `Interface` class. So:\n\n- To load any model from the Hugging Face Hub and create an interface around it, you pass `\"model/\"` or `\"huggingface/\"` followed by the model name, like these examples:\n\n```python\ngr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/gpt2\").launch();\n```\n\n```python\ngr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\", \n    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=5, label=\"Input Text\")  # customizes the input component\n).launch()\n```\n\n- To load any Space from the Hugging Face Hub and recreate it locally (so that you can customize the inputs and outputs for example), you pass `\"spaces/\"` followed by the model name:\n\n```python\ngr.Interface.load(\"spaces/eugenesiow/remove-bg\", \n                  inputs=\"webcam\", \n                  title=\"Remove your webcam background!\").launch()\n```\n\nOne of the great things about loading Hugging Face models or spaces using Gradio is that you can then immediately use the resulting `Interface` object just like function in your Python code (this works for every type of model/space: text, images, audio, video, and even multimodal models):\n\n```python\nio = gr.Interface.load(\"models/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B\")\nio(\"It was the best of times\")  # outputs model completion\n```\n\n## Putting Interfaces in Parallel and Series\n\nGradio also lets you mix interfaces very easily using the `gradio.Parallel` and `gradio.Series` classes. `Parallel` lets you put two similar models (if they have the same input type) in parallel to compare model predictions:\n\n```python\ngenerator1 = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/gpt2\")\ngenerator2 = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B\")\ngenerator3 = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\")\n\ngr.Parallel(generator1, generator2, generator3).launch()\n```\n\n`Series` lets you put models and spaces in series, piping the output of one model into the input of the next model. \n\n```python\ngenerator = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/gpt2\")\ntranslator = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/t5-small\")\n\ngr.Series(generator, translator).launch()  \n# this demo generates text, then translates it to German, and outputs the final result.\n```\n\nAnd of course, you can also mix `Parallel` and `Series` together whenever that makes sense!\n\nLearn more about Parallel and Series in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs#parallel).

So:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To load any model from the Hugging Face Hub and create an interface around it, you pass <code>\"model/\"</code> or <code>\"huggingface/\"</code> followed by the model name, like these examples:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/gpt2\").launch();\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\", \n    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=5, label=\"Input Text\")  # customizes the input component\n).launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To load any Space from the Hugging Face Hub and recreate it locally (so that you can customize the inputs and outputs for example), you pass <code>\"spaces/\"</code> followed by the model name:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>gr.Interface.load(\"spaces/eugenesiow/remove-bg\", \n                  inputs=\"webcam\", \n                  title=\"Remove your webcam background!\").launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>One of the great things about loading Hugging Face models or spaces using Gradio is that you can then immediately use the resulting <code>Interface</code> object just like function in your Python code (this works for every type of model/space: text, images, audio, video, and even multimodal models):</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>io = gr.Interface.load(\"models/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B\")\nio(\"It was the best of times\")  # outputs model completion\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"putting-interfaces-in-parallel-and-series\">Putting Interfaces in Parallel and Series</h2>\n\n<p>Gradio also lets you mix interfaces very easily using the <code>gradio.Parallel</code> and <code>gradio.Series</code> classes. <code>Parallel</code> lets you put two similar models (if they have the same input type) in parallel to compare model predictions:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>generator1 = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/gpt2\")\ngenerator2 = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B\")\ngenerator3 = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\")\n\ngr.Parallel(generator1, generator2, generator3).launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><code>Series</code> lets you put models and spaces in series, piping the output of one model into the input of the next model. </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>generator = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/gpt2\")\ntranslator = gr.Interface.load(\"huggingface/t5-small\")\n\ngr.Series(generator, translator).launch()  \n# this demo generates text, then translates it to German, and outputs the final result.\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>And of course, you can also mix <code>Parallel</code> and <code>Series</code> together whenever that makes sense!</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about Parallel and Series in the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/docs#parallel\">docs</a>. </p>\n", "tags": [], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/advanced-interface-features/", "contributor": null}, {"name": "four-kinds-of-interfaces", "category": "building-interfaces", "pretty_category": "Building Interfaces", "guide_index": 5, "absolute_index": 7, "pretty_name": "Four Kinds Of Interfaces", "content": "# The 4 Kinds of Gradio Interfaces\n\nSo far, we've always assumed that in order to build an Gradio demo, you need both inputs and outputs.

This means that the output produced overrides the input (e.g. a text autocomplete model)\n\nDepending on the kind of demo, the user interface (UI) looks slightly different:\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/interfaces4.png)\n\n\nLet's see how to build each kind of demo using the `Interface` class, along with examples:\n\n\n## Standard demos\n\nTo create a demo that has both the input and the output components, you simply need to set the values of the `inputs` and `outputs` parameter in `Interface()`. Here's an example demo of a simple image filter:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef sepia(input_img):\n    sepia_filter = np.array([\n        [0.393, 0.769, 0.189], \n        [0.349, 0.686, 0.168], \n        [0.272, 0.534, 0.131]\n    ])\n    sepia_img = input_img.dot(sepia_filter.T)\n    sepia_img /= sepia_img.max()\n    return sepia_img\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(sepia, gr.Image(shape=(200, 200)), \"image\")\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/sepia_filter'></gradio-app>\n\n\n## Output-only demos\n\nWhat about demos that only contain outputs? In order to build such a demo, you simply set the value of the `inputs` parameter in `Interface()` to `None`. Here's an example demo of a mock image generation model:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\n\ndef fake_gan():\n    time.sleep(1)\n    images = [\n            \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507003211169-0a1dd7228f2d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=387&q=80\",\n            \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554151228-14d9def656e4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=386&q=80\",\n            \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542909168-82c3e7fdca5c?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MXx8aHVtYW4lMjBmYWNlfGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&w=1000&q=80\",\n    ]\n    return images\n\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=fake_gan,\n    inputs=None,\n    outputs=gr.Gallery(label=\"Generated Images\").style(grid=[2]),\n    title=\"FD-GAN\",\n    description=\"This is a fake demo of a GAN. In reality, the images are randomly chosen from Unsplash.\",\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/fake_gan_no_input'></gradio-app>\n\n## Input-only demos\n\nSimilarly, to create a demo that only contains inputs, set the value of `outputs` parameter in `Interface()` to be `None`. Here's an example demo that saves any uploaded image to disk:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\nimport gradio as gr \n\ndef save_image_random_name(image):\n    random_string = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters, k=20)) + '.png'\n    image.save(random_string)\n    print(f\"Saved image to {random_string}!\")\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=save_image_random_name, \n    inputs=gr.Image(type=\"pil\"), \n    outputs=None,\n)\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/save_file_no_output'></gradio-app>\n\n## Unified demos\n\nA demo that has a single component as both the input and the output. It can simply be created by setting the values of the `inputs` and `outputs` parameter as the same component. Here's an example demo of a text generation model:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\ngenerator = pipeline('text-generation', model = 'gpt2')\n\ndef generate_text(text_prompt):\n  response = generator(text_prompt, max_length = 30, num_return_sequences=5)\n  return response[0]['generated_text']\n\ntextbox = gr.Textbox()\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(generate_text, textbox, textbox)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/unified_demo_text_generation'></gradio-app>\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"the-4-kinds-of-gradio-interfaces\">The 4 Kinds of Gradio Interfaces</h1>\n\n<p>So far, we've always assumed that in order to build an Gradio demo, you need both inputs and outputs.

Let's dive deeper. This guide will cover the how Blocks are structured, event listeners and their types, running events continuously, updating configurations, and using dictionaries vs lists. \n\n## Blocks Structure\n\nTake a look at the demo below.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    name = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output Box\")\n    greet_btn = gr.Button(\"Greet\")\n    greet_btn.click(fn=greet, inputs=name, outputs=output, api_name=\"greet\")\n   \n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/hello_blocks'></gradio-app>\n\n- First, note the `with gr.Blocks() as demo:` clause. The Blocks app code will be contained within this clause.\n- Next come the Components. These are the same Components used in `Interface`. However, instead of being passed to some constructor, Components are automatically added to the Blocks as they are created within the `with` clause.\n- Finally, the `click()` event listener. Event listeners define the data flow within the app. In the example above, the listener ties the two Textboxes together. The Textbox `name` acts as the input and Textbox `output` acts as the output to the `greet` method. This dataflow is triggered when the Button `greet_btn` is clicked. Like an Interface, an event listener can take multiple inputs or outputs.\n\n## Event Listeners and Interactivity\n\nIn the example above, you'll notice that you are able to edit Textbox `name`, but not Textbox `output`. This is because any Component that acts as an input to an event listener is made interactive. However, since Textbox `output` acts only as an output, it is not interactive. You can directly configure the interactivity of a Component with the `interactive=` keyword argument. \n\n```python\noutput = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\", interactive=True)\n```\n\n## Types of Event Listeners\n\nTake a look at the demo below:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef welcome(name):\n    return f\"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\n    \"\"\"\n    # Hello World!\n    Start typing below to see the output.\n    \"\"\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n    inp.change(welcome, inp, out)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_hello'></gradio-app>\n\nInstead of being triggered by a click, the `welcome` function is triggered by typing in the Textbox `inp`. This is due to the `change()` event listener. Different Components support different event listeners. For example, the `Video` Component supports a `play()` event listener, triggered when a user presses play. See the [Docs](http://gradio.app/docs#components) for the event listeners for each Component.\n\n## Multiple Data Flows\n\nA Blocks app is not limited to a single data flow the way Interfaces are. Take a look at the demo below:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef increase(num):\n    return num + 1\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    a = gr.Number(label=\"a\")\n    b = gr.Number(label=\"b\")\n    btoa = gr.Button(\"a > b\")\n    atob = gr.Button(\"b > a\")\n    atob.click(increase, a, b)\n    btoa.click(increase, b, a)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/reversible_flow'></gradio-app>\n\nNote that `num1` can act as input to `num2`, and also vice-versa! As your apps get more complex, you will have many data flows connecting various Components. \n\nHere's an example of a \"multi-step\" demo, where the output of one model (a speech-to-text model) gets fed into the next model (a sentiment classifier).\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\nasr = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\", \"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\nclassifier = pipeline(\"text-classification\")\n\n\ndef speech_to_text(speech):\n    text = asr(speech)[\"text\"]\n    return text\n\n\ndef text_to_sentiment(text):\n    return classifier(text)[0][\"label\"]\n\n\ndemo = gr.Blocks()\n\nwith demo:\n    audio_file = gr.Audio(type=\"filepath\")\n    text = gr.Textbox()\n    label = gr.Label()\n\n    b1 = gr.Button(\"Recognize Speech\")\n    b2 = gr.Button(\"Classify Sentiment\")\n\n    b1.click(speech_to_text, inputs=audio_file, outputs=text)\n    b2.click(text_to_sentiment, inputs=text, outputs=label)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_speech_text_sentiment'></gradio-app>\n\n## Function Input List vs Dict\n\nThe event listeners you've seen so far have a single input component. If you'd like to have multiple input components pass data to the function, you have two options on how the function can accept input component values:\n\n1. as a list of arguments, or\n2. as a single dictionary of values, keyed by the component\n\nLet's see an example of each:\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    a = gr.Number(label=\"a\")\n    b = gr.Number(label=\"b\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        add_btn = gr.Button(\"Add\")\n        sub_btn = gr.Button(\"Subtract\")\n    c = gr.Number(label=\"sum\")\n\n    def add(num1, num2):\n        return num1 + num2\n    add_btn.click(add, inputs=[a, b], outputs=c)\n\n    def sub(data):\n        return data[a] - data[b]\n    sub_btn.click(sub, inputs={a, b}, outputs=c)\n\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nBoth `add()` and `sub()` take `a` and `b` as inputs. However, the syntax is different between these listeners. \n\n1. To the `add_btn` listener, we pass the inputs as a list. The function `add()` takes each of these inputs as arguments. The value of `a` maps to the argument `num1`, and the value of `b` maps to the argument `num2`.\n2. To the `sub_btn` listener, we pass the inputs as a set (note the curly brackets!). The function `sub()` takes a single dictionary argument `data`, where the keys are the input components, and the values are the values of those components.\n\nIt is a matter of preference which syntax you prefer! For functions with many input components, option 2 may be easier to manage.\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/calculator_list_and_dict'></gradio-app>\n\n## Function Return List vs Dict\n\nSimilarly, you may return values for multiple output components either as:\n\n1. a list of values, or\n2. a dictionary keyed by the component\n\nLet's first see an example of (1), where we set the values of two output components by returning two values:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    food_box = gr.Number(value=10, label=\"Food Count\")\n    status_box = gr.Textbox()\n    def eat(food):\n        if food > 0:\n            return food - 1, \"full\"\n        else:\n            return 0, \"hungry\"\n    gr.Button(\"EAT\").click(\n        fn=eat, \n        inputs=food_box,\n        outputs=[food_box, status_box]\n    )\n```\n\nAbove, each return statement returns two values corresponding to `food_box` and `status_box`, respectively.\n\nInstead of returning a list of values corresponding to each output component in order, you can also return a dictionary, with the key corresponding to the output component and the value as the new value. This also allows you to skip updating some output components. \n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    food_box = gr.Number(value=10, label=\"Food Count\")\n    status_box = gr.Textbox()\n    def eat(food):\n        if food > 0:\n            return {food_box: food - 1, status_box: \"full\"}\n        else:\n            return {status_box: \"hungry\"}\n    gr.Button(\"EAT\").click(\n        fn=eat, \n        inputs=food_box,\n        outputs=[food_box, status_box]\n    )\n```\n\nNotice how when there is no food, we only update the `status_box` element. We skipped updating the `food_box` component.\n\nDictionary returns are helpful when an event listener affects many components on return, or conditionally affects outputs and not others.\n\nKeep in mind that with dictionary returns, we still need to specify the possible outputs in the event listener.\n\n## Updating Component Configurations\n\nThe return value of an event listener function is usually the updated value of the corresponding output Component. Sometimes we want to update the configuration of the Component as well, such as the visibility. In this case, we return a `gr.update()` object instead of just the update Component value.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef change_textbox(choice):\n    if choice == \"short\":\n        return gr.update(lines=2, visible=True, value=\"Short story: \")\n    elif choice == \"long\":\n        return gr.update(lines=8, visible=True, value=\"Long story...\")\n    else:\n        return gr.update(visible=False)\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    radio = gr.Radio(\n        [\"short\", \"long\", \"none\"], label=\"Essay Length to Write?\"\n    )\n    text = gr.Textbox(lines=2, interactive=True)\n    radio.change(fn=change_textbox, inputs=radio, outputs=text)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_essay_update'></gradio-app>\n\nSee how we can configure the Textbox itself through the `gr.update()` method. The `value=` argument can still be used to update the value along with Component configuration.\n\n## Running Events Consecutively\n\nYou can also run events consecutively by using the `then` method of an event listener. This will run an event after the previous event has finished running. This is useful for running events that update components in multiple steps. \n\nFor example, in the chatbot example below, we first update the chatbot with the user message immediately, and then update the chatbot with the computer response after a simulated delay.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport random\nimport time\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()\n    msg = gr.Textbox()\n    clear = gr.ClearButton([msg, chatbot])\n\n    def respond(message, chat_history):\n        bot_message = random.choice([\"How are you?\", \"I love you\", \"I'm very hungry\"])\n        chat_history.append((message, bot_message))\n        time.sleep(2)\n        return \"\", chat_history\n\n    msg.submit(respond, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot])\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_simple'></gradio-app>\n\nThe `.then()` method of an event listener executes the subsequent event regardless of whether the previous event raised any errors. If you'd like to  only run subsequent events if the previous event executed successfully, use the `.success()` method, which takes the same arguments as `.then()`.\n\n## Running Events Continuously\n\nYou can run events on a fixed schedule using the `every` parameter of the event listener. This will run the event\n`every` number of seconds while the client connection is open. If the connection is closed, the event will stop running after the following iteration.\nNote that this does not take into account the runtime of the event itself. So a function\nwith a 1 second runtime running with `every=5`, would actually run every 6 seconds.\n\nHere is an example of a sine curve that updates every second!\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport gradio as gr\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nplot_end = 2 * math.pi\n\n\ndef get_plot(period=1):\n    global plot_end\n    x = np.arange(plot_end - 2 * math.pi, plot_end, 0.02)\n    y = np.sin(2*math.pi*period * x)\n    fig = px.line(x=x, y=y)\n    plot_end += 2 * math.pi\n    if plot_end > 1000:\n        plot_end = 2 * math.pi\n    return fig\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.Markdown(\"Change the value of the slider to automatically update the plot\")\n            period = gr.Slider(label=\"Period of plot\", value=1, minimum=0, maximum=10, step=1)\n            plot = gr.Plot(label=\"Plot (updates every half second)\")\n\n    dep = demo.load(get_plot, None, plot, every=1)\n    period.change(get_plot, period, plot, every=1, cancels=[dep])\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.queue().launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/sine_curve'></gradio-app>\n\n## Gathering Event Data\n\nYou can gather specific data about an event by adding the associated event data class as a type hint to an argument in the event listener function. \n\nFor example, event data for `.select()` can be type hinted by a `gradio.SelectData` argument. This event is triggered when a user selects some part of the triggering component, and the event data includes information about what the user specifically selected. If a user selected a specific word in a `Textbox`, a specific image in a `Gallery`, or a specific cell in a `DataFrame`, the event data argument would contain information about the specific selection.\n\nIn the 2 player tic-tac-toe demo below, a user can select a cell in the `DataFrame` to make a move. The event data argument contains information about the specific cell that was selected. We can first check to see if the cell is empty, and then update the cell with the user's move. \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    turn = gr.Textbox(\"X\", interactive=False, label=\"Turn\")\n    board = gr.Dataframe(value=[[\"\", \"\", \"\"]] * 3, interactive=False, type=\"array\")\n\n    def place(board, turn, evt: gr.SelectData):\n        if evt.value:\n            return board, turn\n        board[evt.index[0]][evt.index[1]] = turn\n        turn = \"O\" if turn == \"X\" else \"X\"\n        return board, turn\n\n    board.select(place, [board, turn], [board, turn])\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/tictactoe'></gradio-app>", "html": "<h1 id=\"blocks-and-event-listeners\">Blocks and Event Listeners</h1>\n\n<p>We took a quick look at Blocks in the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control\">Quickstart</a>. Let's dive deeper. This guide will cover the how Blocks are structured, event listeners and their types, running events continuously, updating configurations, and using dictionaries vs lists. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"blocks-structure\">Blocks Structure</h2>\n\n<p>Take a look at the demo below.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ndef greet(name):\n    return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    name = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output Box\")\n    greet_btn = gr.Button(\"Greet\")\n    greet_btn.click(fn=greet, inputs=name, outputs=output, api_name=\"greet\")\n\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/hello_blocks'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>First, note the <code>with gr.Blocks() as demo:</code> clause. The Blocks app code will be contained within this clause.</li>\n<li>Next come the Components. These are the same Components used in <code>Interface</code>. However, instead of being passed to some constructor, Components are automatically added to the Blocks as they are created within the <code>with</code> clause.</li>\n<li>Finally, the <code>click()</code> event listener. Event listeners define the data flow within the app. In the example above, the listener ties the two Textboxes together. The Textbox <code>name</code> acts as the input and Textbox <code>output</code> acts as the output to the <code>greet</code> method. This dataflow is triggered when the Button <code>greet_btn</code> is clicked. Like an Interface, an event listener can take multiple inputs or outputs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"event-listeners-and-interactivity\">Event Listeners and Interactivity</h2>\n\n<p>In the example above, you'll notice that you are able to edit Textbox <code>name</code>, but not Textbox <code>output</code>. This is because any Component that acts as an input to an event listener is made interactive. However, since Textbox <code>output</code> acts only as an output, it is not interactive. You can directly configure the interactivity of a Component with the <code>interactive=</code> keyword argument. </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\", interactive=True)\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"types-of-event-listeners\">Types of Event Listeners</h2>\n\n<p>Take a look at the demo below:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ndef welcome(name):\n    return f\"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\n    \"\"\"\n    # Hello World!\n    Start typing below to see the output.\n    \"\"\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n    inp.change(welcome, inp, out)\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_hello'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<p>Instead of being triggered by a click, the <code>welcome</code> function is triggered by typing in the Textbox <code>inp</code>. This is due to the <code>change()</code> event listener. Different Components support different event listeners. For example, the <code>Video</code> Component supports a <code>play()</code> event listener, triggered when a user presses play. See the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gradio.app/docs#components\">Docs</a> for the event listeners for each Component.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"multiple-data-flows\">Multiple Data Flows</h2>\n\n<p>A Blocks app is not limited to a single data flow the way Interfaces are. Take a look at the demo below:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ndef increase(num):\n    return num + 1\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    a = gr.Number(label=\"a\")\n    b = gr.Number(label=\"b\")\n    btoa = gr.Button(\"a > b\")\n    atob = gr.Button(\"b > a\")\n    atob.click(increase, a, b)\n    btoa.click(increase, b, a)\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/reversible_flow'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<p>Note that <code>num1</code> can act as input to <code>num2</code>, and also vice-versa! As your apps get more complex, you will have many data flows connecting various Components. </p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of a \"multi-step\" demo, where the output of one model (a speech-to-text model) gets fed into the next model (a sentiment classifier).</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from transformers import pipeline\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\nasr = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\", \"facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h\")\nclassifier = pipeline(\"text-classification\")\n\n\ndef speech_to_text(speech):\n    text = asr(speech)[\"text\"]\n    return text\n\n\ndef text_to_sentiment(text):\n    return classifier(text)[0][\"label\"]\n\n\ndemo = gr.Blocks()\n\nwith demo:\n    audio_file = gr.Audio(type=\"filepath\")\n    text = gr.Textbox()\n    label = gr.Label()\n\n    b1 = gr.Button(\"Recognize Speech\")\n    b2 = gr.Button(\"Classify Sentiment\")\n\n    b1.click(speech_to_text, inputs=audio_file, outputs=text)\n    b2.click(text_to_sentiment, inputs=text, outputs=label)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/blocks<em>speech</em>text_sentiment'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"function-input-list-vs-dict\">Function Input List vs Dict</h2>\n\n<p>The event listeners you've seen so far have a single input component. If you'd like to have multiple input components pass data to the function, you have two options on how the function can accept input component values:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>as a list of arguments, or</li>\n<li>as a single dictionary of values, keyed by the component</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let's see an example of each:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    a = gr.Number(label=\"a\")\n    b = gr.Number(label=\"b\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        add_btn = gr.Button(\"Add\")\n        sub_btn = gr.Button(\"Subtract\")\n    c = gr.Number(label=\"sum\")\n\n    def add(num1, num2):\n        return num1 + num2\n    add_btn.click(add, inputs=[a, b], outputs=c)\n\n    def sub(data):\n        return data[a] - data[b]\n    sub_btn.click(sub, inputs={a, b}, outputs=c)\n\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Both <code>add()</code> and <code>sub()</code> take <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> as inputs. However, the syntax is different between these listeners. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>To the <code>add_btn</code> listener, we pass the inputs as a list. The function <code>add()</code> takes each of these inputs as arguments. The value of <code>a</code> maps to the argument <code>num1</code>, and the value of <code>b</code> maps to the argument <code>num2</code>.</li>\n<li>To the <code>sub_btn</code> listener, we pass the inputs as a set (note the curly brackets!). The function <code>sub()</code> takes a single dictionary argument <code>data</code>, where the keys are the input components, and the values are the values of those components.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is a matter of preference which syntax you prefer! For functions with many input components, option 2 may be easier to manage.</p>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/calculator<em>list</em>and_dict'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"function-return-list-vs-dict\">Function Return List vs Dict</h2>\n\n<p>Similarly, you may return values for multiple output components either as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>a list of values, or</li>\n<li>a dictionary keyed by the component</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let's first see an example of (1), where we set the values of two output components by returning two values:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    food_box = gr.Number(value=10, label=\"Food Count\")\n    status_box = gr.Textbox()\n    def eat(food):\n        if food > 0:\n            return food - 1, \"full\"\n        else:\n            return 0, \"hungry\"\n    gr.Button(\"EAT\").click(\n        fn=eat, \n        inputs=food_box,\n        outputs=[food_box, status_box]\n    )\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Above, each return statement returns two values corresponding to <code>food_box</code> and <code>status_box</code>, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of returning a list of values corresponding to each output component in order, you can also return a dictionary, with the key corresponding to the output component and the value as the new value. This also allows you to skip updating some output components. </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    food_box = gr.Number(value=10, label=\"Food Count\")\n    status_box = gr.Textbox()\n    def eat(food):\n        if food > 0:\n            return {food_box: food - 1, status_box: \"full\"}\n        else:\n            return {status_box: \"hungry\"}\n    gr.Button(\"EAT\").click(\n        fn=eat, \n        inputs=food_box,\n        outputs=[food_box, status_box]\n    )\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Notice how when there is no food, we only update the <code>status_box</code> element. We skipped updating the <code>food_box</code> component.</p>\n\n<p>Dictionary returns are helpful when an event listener affects many components on return, or conditionally affects outputs and not others.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that with dictionary returns, we still need to specify the possible outputs in the event listener.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"updating-component-configurations\">Updating Component Configurations</h2>\n\n<p>The return value of an event listener function is usually the updated value of the corresponding output Component. Sometimes we want to update the configuration of the Component as well, such as the visibility. In this case, we return a <code>gr.update()</code> object instead of just the update Component value.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ndef change_textbox(choice):\n    if choice == \"short\":\n        return gr.update(lines=2, visible=True, value=\"Short story: \")\n    elif choice == \"long\":\n        return gr.update(lines=8, visible=True, value=\"Long story...\")\n    else:\n        return gr.update(visible=False)\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    radio = gr.Radio(\n        [\"short\", \"long\", \"none\"], label=\"Essay Length to Write?\"\n    )\n    text = gr.Textbox(lines=2, interactive=True)\n    radio.change(fn=change_textbox, inputs=radio, outputs=text)\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/blocks<em>essay</em>update'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<p>See how we can configure the Textbox itself through the <code>gr.update()</code> method.

Let's take a look at how we can rearrange Components. Under the hood, this layout structure uses the [flexbox model of web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox).\n\n## Rows\n\nElements within a `with gr.Row` clause will all be displayed horizontally. For example, to display two Buttons side by side:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        btn1 = gr.Button(\"Button 1\")\n        btn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\")\n```\n\nTo make every element in a Row have the same height, use the `equal_height` argument of the `style` method.\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row().style(equal_height=True):\n        textbox = gr.Textbox()\n        btn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\")\n```\n\nThe widths of elements in a Row can be controlled via a combination of `scale` and `min_width` arguments that are present in every Component.\n\n- `scale` is an integer that defines how an element will take up space in a Row. If scale is set to `0`, and element will not expand to take up space. If scale is set to `1` or greater, the element well expand. Multiple elements in a row will expand proportional to their scale. Below, `btn1` will expand twice as much as `btn2`, while `btn0` will not expand at all:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        btn0 = gr.Button(\"Button 0\", scale=0)\n        btn1 = gr.Button(\"Button 1\", scale=1)\n        btn2 = gr.Button(\"Button 2\", scale=2)\n```\n\n- `min_width` will set the minimum width the element will take. The Row will wrap if there isn't sufficient space to satisfy all `min_width` values.\n\nLearn more about Rows in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#row).\n\n## Columns and Nesting\n\nComponents within a Column will be placed vertically atop each other. Since the vertical layout is the default layout for Blocks apps anyway, to be useful, Columns are usually  nested within Rows. For example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        text1 = gr.Textbox(label=\"t1\")\n        slider2 = gr.Textbox(label=\"s2\")\n        drop3 = gr.Dropdown([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], label=\"d3\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column(scale=1, min_width=600):\n            text1 = gr.Textbox(label=\"prompt 1\")\n            text2 = gr.Textbox(label=\"prompt 2\")\n            inbtw = gr.Button(\"Between\")\n            text4 = gr.Textbox(label=\"prompt 1\")\n            text5 = gr.Textbox(label=\"prompt 2\")\n        with gr.Column(scale=2, min_width=600):\n            img1 = gr.Image(\"images/cheetah.jpg\")\n            btn = gr.Button(\"Go\").style(full_width=True)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/rows_and_columns'></gradio-app>\n\nSee how the first column has two Textboxes arranged vertically. The second column has an Image and Button arranged vertically. Notice how the relative widths of the two columns is set by the `scale` parameter. The column with twice the `scale` value takes up twice the width.\n\nLearn more about Columns in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs/#column).\n\n## Tabs and Accordions\n\nYou can also create Tabs using the `with gr.Tab('tab_name'):` clause. Any component created inside of a `with gr.Tab('tab_name'):` context appears in that tab. Consecutive Tab clauses are grouped together so that a single tab can be selected at one time, and only the components within that Tab's context are shown.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport gradio as gr\n\n\ndef flip_text(x):\n    return x[::-1]\n\n\ndef flip_image(x):\n    return np.fliplr(x)\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"Flip text or image files using this demo.\")\n    with gr.Tab(\"Flip Text\"):\n        text_input = gr.Textbox()\n        text_output = gr.Textbox()\n        text_button = gr.Button(\"Flip\")\n    with gr.Tab(\"Flip Image\"):\n        with gr.Row():\n            image_input = gr.Image()\n            image_output = gr.Image()\n        image_button = gr.Button(\"Flip\")\n\n    with gr.Accordion(\"Open for More!\"):\n        gr.Markdown(\"Look at me...\")\n\n    text_button.click(flip_text, inputs=text_input, outputs=text_output)\n    image_button.click(flip_image, inputs=image_input, outputs=image_output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_flipper'></gradio-app>\n\nAlso note the `gr.Accordion('label')` in this example. The Accordion is a layout that can be toggled open or closed. Like `Tabs`, it is a layout element that can selectively hide or show content. Any components that are defined inside of a `with gr.Accordion('label'):` will be hidden or shown when the accordion's toggle icon is clicked.\n\nLearn more about [Tabs](https://gradio.app/docs/#tab) and [Accordions](https://gradio.app/docs/#accordion) in the docs.\n\n## Visibility\n\nBoth Components and Layout elements have a `visible` argument that can set initially and also updated using `gr.update()`. Setting `gr.update(visible=...)` on a Column can be used to show or hide a set of Components.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    error_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Error\", visible=False)\n\n    name_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    age_box = gr.Number(label=\"Age\", minimum=0, maximum=100)\n    symptoms_box = gr.CheckboxGroup([\"Cough\", \"Fever\", \"Runny Nose\"])\n    submit_btn = gr.Button(\"Submit\")\n\n    with gr.Column(visible=False) as output_col:\n        diagnosis_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Diagnosis\")\n        patient_summary_box = gr.Textbox(label=\"Patient Summary\")\n\n    def submit(name, age, symptoms):\n        if len(name) == 0:\n            return {error_box: gr.update(value=\"Enter name\", visible=True)}\n        return {\n            output_col: gr.update(visible=True),\n            diagnosis_box: \"covid\" if \"Cough\" in symptoms else \"flu\",\n            patient_summary_box: f\"{name}, {age} y/o\",\n        }\n\n    submit_btn.click(\n        submit,\n        [name_box, age_box, symptoms_box],\n        [error_box, diagnosis_box, patient_summary_box, output_col],\n    )\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_form'></gradio-app>\n\n## Variable Number of Outputs\n\nBy adjusting the visibility of components in a dynamic way, it is possible to create\ndemos with Gradio that support a *variable numbers of outputs*. Here's a very simple example\nwhere the number of output textboxes is controlled by an input slider:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nmax_textboxes = 10\n\ndef variable_outputs(k):\n    k = int(k)\n    return [gr.Textbox.update(visible=True)]*k + [gr.Textbox.update(visible=False)]*(max_textboxes-k)\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    s = gr.Slider(1, max_textboxes, value=max_textboxes, step=1, label=\"How many textboxes to show:\")\n    textboxes = []\n    for i in range(max_textboxes):\n        t = gr.Textbox(f\"Textbox {i}\")\n        textboxes.append(t)\n\n    s.change(variable_outputs, s, textboxes)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n   demo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/variable_outputs'></gradio-app>\n\n## Defining and Rendering Components Separately\n\nIn some cases, you might want to define components before you actually render them in your UI. For instance, you might want to show an examples section using `gr.Examples` above the corresponding `gr.Textbox` input. Since `gr.Examples` requires as a parameter the input component object, you will need to first define the input component, but then render it later, after you have defined the `gr.Examples` object.\n\nThe solution to this is to define the `gr.Textbox` outside of the `gr.Blocks()` scope and use the component's `.render()` method wherever you'd like it placed in the UI.\n\nHere's a full code example:\n\n```python\ninput_textbox = gr.Textbox()\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Examples([\"hello\", \"bonjour\", \"merhaba\"], input_textbox)\n    input_textbox.render()\n```\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"controlling-layout\">Controlling Layout</h1>\n\n<p>By default, Components in Blocks are arranged vertically.

We recommend using query selectors sparingly.\n\n## Custom CSS\n\nGradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the `theme=` kwarg to the `Blocks` constructor. For example:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Glass()):\n    ...\n```\n\nGradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from `gr.themes.*`. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the [Theming guide](/guides/theming-guide) for more details.\n\nFor additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS to your app using the `css=` kwarg.\n\nThe base class for the Gradio app is `gradio-container`, so here's an example that changes the background color of the Gradio app:\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(css=\".gradio-container {background-color: red}\") as demo:\n    ...\n```\n\nIf you'd like to reference external files in your css, preface the file path (which can be a relative or absolute path) with `\"file=\"`, for example:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(css=\".gradio-container {background: url('file=clouds.jpg')}\") as demo:\n    ...\n```\n\nYou can also pass the filepath to a CSS file to the `css` argument. \n\n## The `elem_id` and `elem_classes` Arguments\n\nYou can `elem_id` to add an HTML element `id` to any component, and `elem_classes` to add a class or list of classes. This will allow you to select elements more easily with CSS. This approach is also more likely to be stable across Gradio versions as built-in class names or ids may change (however, as mentioned in the warning above, we cannot guarantee complete compatibility between Gradio versions if you use custom CSS as the DOM elements may themselves change).\n\n```python\ncss = \"\"\"\n#warning {background-color: #FFCCCB} \n.feedback textarea {font-size: 24px !important}\n\"\"\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks(css=css) as demo:\n    box1 = gr.Textbox(value=\"Good Job\", elem_classes=\"feedback\")\n    box2 = gr.Textbox(value=\"Failure\", elem_id=\"warning\", elem_classes=\"feedback\")\n```\n\nThe CSS `#warning` ruleset will only target the second Textbox, while the `.feedback` ruleset will target both. Note that when targeting classes, you might need to put the `!important` selector to override the default Gradio styles.\n\n## Custom JS\n\nEvent listeners have a `_js` argument that can take a Javascript function as a string and treat it just like a Python event listener function. You can pass both a Javascript function and a Python function (in which case the Javascript function is run first) or only Javascript (and set the Python `fn` to `None`). Take a look at the code below:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nblocks = gr.Blocks()\n\nwith blocks as demo:\n    subject = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"subject\")\n    verb = gr.Radio([\"ate\", \"loved\", \"hated\"])\n    object = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"object\")\n\n    with gr.Row():\n        btn = gr.Button(\"Create sentence.\")\n        reverse_btn = gr.Button(\"Reverse sentence.\")\n        foo_bar_btn = gr.Button(\"Append foo\")\n        reverse_then_to_the_server_btn = gr.Button(\n            \"Reverse sentence and send to server.\"\n        )\n\n    def sentence_maker(w1, w2, w3):\n        return f\"{w1} {w2} {w3}\"\n\n    output1 = gr.Textbox(label=\"output 1\")\n    output2 = gr.Textbox(label=\"verb\")\n    output3 = gr.Textbox(label=\"verb reversed\")\n    output4 = gr.Textbox(label=\"front end process and then send to backend\")\n\n    btn.click(sentence_maker, [subject, verb, object], output1)\n    reverse_btn.click(\n        None, [subject, verb, object], output2, _js=\"(s, v, o) => o + ' ' + v + ' ' + s\"\n    )\n    verb.change(lambda x: x, verb, output3, _js=\"(x) => [...x].reverse().join('')\")\n    foo_bar_btn.click(None, [], subject, _js=\"(x) => x + ' foo'\")\n\n    reverse_then_to_the_server_btn.click(\n        sentence_maker,\n        [subject, verb, object],\n        output4,\n        _js=\"(s, v, o) => [s, v, o].map(x => [...x].reverse().join(''))\",\n    )\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_js_methods'></gradio-app>", "html": "<h1 id=\"custom-js-and-css\">Custom JS and CSS</h1>\n\n<p>This guide covers how to style Blocks with more flexibility, as well as adding Javascript code to event listeners. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: The use of query selectors in custom JS and CSS is <em>not</em> guaranteed to work across Gradio versions as the Gradio HTML DOM may change. We recommend using query selectors sparingly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"custom-css\">Custom CSS</h2>\n\n<p>Gradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the <code>theme=</code> kwarg to the <code>Blocks</code> constructor. For example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Glass()):\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Gradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from <code>gr.themes.*</code>. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/guides/theming-guide\">Theming guide</a> for more details.</p>\n\n<p>For additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS to your app using the <code>css=</code> kwarg.</p>\n\n<p>The base class for the Gradio app is <code>gradio-container</code>, so here's an example that changes the background color of the Gradio app:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(css=\".gradio-container {background-color: red}\") as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>If you'd like to reference external files in your css, preface the file path (which can be a relative or absolute path) with <code>\"file=\"</code>, for example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(css=\".gradio-container {background: url('file=clouds.jpg')}\") as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>You can also pass the filepath to a CSS file to the <code>css</code> argument. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-elem_id-and-elem_classes-arguments\">The <code>elem_id</code> and <code>elem_classes</code> Arguments</h2>\n\n<p>You can <code>elem_id</code> to add an HTML element <code>id</code> to any component, and <code>elem_classes</code> to add a class or list of classes. This will allow you to select elements more easily with CSS. This approach is also more likely to be stable across Gradio versions as built-in class names or ids may change (however, as mentioned in the warning above, we cannot guarantee complete compatibility between Gradio versions if you use custom CSS as the DOM elements may themselves change).</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>css = \"\"\"\n#warning {background-color: #FFCCCB} \n.feedback textarea {font-size: 24px !important}\n\"\"\"\n\nwith gr.Blocks(css=css) as demo:\n    box1 = gr.Textbox(value=\"Good Job\", elem_classes=\"feedback\")\n    box2 = gr.Textbox(value=\"Failure\", elem_id=\"warning\", elem_classes=\"feedback\")\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The CSS <code>#warning</code> ruleset will only target the second Textbox, while the <code>.feedback</code> ruleset will target both.

Make sure to [read that guide first](https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control).\n\n## Introduction\n\nDid you know that apart from being a full-stack machine learning demo, a Gradio Blocks app is also a regular-old python function!?\n\nThis means that if you have a gradio Blocks (or Interface) app called `demo`, you can use `demo` like you would any python function.\n\nSo doing something like `output = demo(\"Hello\", \"friend\")` will run the first event defined in `demo` on the inputs \"Hello\" and \"friend\" and store it\nin the variable `output`.\n\nIf I put you to sleep \ud83e\udd71, please bear with me! By using apps like functions, you can seamlessly compose Gradio apps.\nThe following section will show how.\n\n## Treating Blocks like functions\n\nLet's say we have the following demo that translates english text to german text. \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline(\"translation\", model=\"t5-base\")\n\n\ndef translate(text):\n    return pipe(text)[0][\"translation_text\"]\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            english = gr.Textbox(label=\"English text\")\n            translate_btn = gr.Button(value=\"Translate\")\n        with gr.Column():\n            german = gr.Textbox(label=\"German Text\")\n\n    translate_btn.click(translate, inputs=english, outputs=german, api_name=\"translate-to-german\")\n    examples = gr.Examples(examples=[\"I went to the supermarket yesterday.\", \"Helen is a good swimmer.\"],\n                           inputs=[english])\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nI already went ahead and hosted it in Hugging Face spaces at [gradio/english_translator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/english_translator).\n\nYou can see the demo below as well:\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/english_translator'></gradio-app>\n\nNow, let's say you have an app that generates english text, but you wanted to additionally generate german text.\n\nYou could either:\n\n1. Copy the source code of my english-to-german translation and paste it in your app.\n\n2. Load my english-to-german translation in your app and treat it like a normal python function.\n\nOption 1 technically always works, but it often introduces unwanted complexity.\n\nOption 2 lets you borrow the functionality you want without tightly coupling our apps.\n\nAll you have to do is call the `Blocks.load` class method in your source file.\nAfter that, you can use my translation app like a regular python function!\n\nThe following code snippet and demo shows how to use `Blocks.load`.\n\nNote that the variable `english_translator` is my english to german app, but its used in `generate_text` like a regular function.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nenglish_translator = gr.Blocks.load(name=\"spaces/gradio/english_translator\")\nenglish_generator = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=\"distilgpt2\")\n\n\ndef generate_text(text):\n    english_text = english_generator(text)[0][\"generated_text\"]\n    german_text = english_translator(english_text)\n    return english_text, german_text\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            seed = gr.Text(label=\"Input Phrase\")\n        with gr.Column():\n            english = gr.Text(label=\"Generated English Text\")\n            german = gr.Text(label=\"Generated German Text\")\n    btn = gr.Button(\"Generate\")\n    btn.click(generate_text, inputs=[seed], outputs=[english, german])\n    gr.Examples([\"My name is Clara and I am\"], inputs=[seed])\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/generate_english_german'></gradio-app>\n\n## How to control which function in the app to use\n\nIf the app you are loading defines more than one function, you can specify which function to use\nwith the `fn_index` and `api_name` parameters.\n\nIn the code for our english to german demo, you'll see the following line:\n\n```python\ntranslate_btn.click(translate, inputs=english, outputs=german, api_name=\"translate-to-german\")\n```\n\nThe `api_name` gives this function a unique name in our app. You can use this name to tell gradio which\nfunction in the upstream space you want to use:\n\n```python\nenglish_generator(text, api_name=\"translate-to-german\")[0][\"generated_text\"]\n```\n\nYou can also use the `fn_index` parameter.\nImagine my app also defined an english to spanish translation function.\nIn order to use it in our text generation app, we would use the following code:\n\n```python\nenglish_generator(text, fn_index=1)[0][\"generated_text\"]\n```\n\nFunctions in gradio spaces are zero-indexed, so since the spanish translator would be the second function in my space,\nyou would use index 1. \n\n## Parting Remarks\n\nWe showed how treating a Blocks app like a regular python helps you compose functionality across different apps.\nAny Blocks app can be treated like a function, but a powerful pattern is to `load` an app hosted on \n[Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) prior to treating it like a function in your own app.\nYou can also load models hosted on the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) - see the [Using Hugging Face Integrations](/using_hugging_face_integrations) guide for an example.\n\n### Happy building! \u2692\ufe0f\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"using-gradio-blocks-like-functions\">Using Gradio Blocks Like Functions</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: This Guide builds on the Blocks Introduction.

EMBED\n\nContributed by <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/osanseviero\">Omar Sanseviero</a> \ud83e\udd99 \n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Hugging Face Hub is a central platform that has over 190,000 [models](https://huggingface.co/models), 32,000 [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) and 40,000 [demos](https://huggingface.co/spaces), also known as Spaces. Although Hugging Face is famous for its \ud83e\udd17 transformers and diffusers libraries, the Hub also supports dozens of ML libraries, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, spaCy, and many others across a variety of domains, from computer vision to reinforcement learning.\n\nGradio has multiple features that make it extremely easy to leverage existing models and Spaces on the Hub. This guide walks through these features.\n\n## Using regular inference with `pipeline`\n\nFirst, let's build a simple interface that translates text from English to Spanish. Between the over a thousand models shared by the University of Helsinki, there is an [existing model](https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es), `opus-mt-en-es`, that does precisely this!\n\nThe \ud83e\udd17 transformers library has a very easy-to-use abstraction, [`pipeline()`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.16.2/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline) that handles most of the complex code to offer a simple API for common tasks. By specifying the task and an (optional) model, you can use an existing model with few lines:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline(\"translation\", model=\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\")\n\ndef predict(text):\n  return pipe(text)[0][\"translation_text\"]\n  \ndemo = gr.Interface(\n  fn=predict, \n  inputs='text',\n  outputs='text',\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nBut `gradio` actually makes it even easier to convert a `pipeline` to a demo, simply by using the `gradio.Interface.from_pipeline` methods, which skips the need to specify the input and output components:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport gradio as gr\n\npipe = pipeline(\"translation\", model=\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\")\n\ndemo = gr.Interface.from_pipeline(pipe)\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nThe previous code produces the following interface, which you can try right here in your browser: \n\n\n<gradio-app space=\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\"></gradio-app>\n\n\n## Using Hugging Face Inference API\n\nHugging Face has a free service called the [Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api), which allows you to send HTTP requests to models in the Hub. For transformers or diffusers-based models, the API can be 2 to 10 times faster than running the inference yourself. The API is free (rate limited), and you can switch to dedicated [Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/pricing) when you want to use it in production.\n\nLet's try the same demo as above but using the Inference API instead of loading the model yourself. Given a Hugging Face model supported in the Inference API, Gradio can automatically infer the expected input and output and make the underlying server calls, so you don't have to worry about defining the prediction function. Here is what the code would look like!\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndemo = gr.load(\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\", src=\"models\")\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nNotice that we just put specify the model name and state that the `src` should be `models` (Hugging Face's Model Hub). There is no need to install any dependencies (except `gradio`) since you are not loading the model on your computer.\n\nYou might notice that the first inference takes about 20 seconds. This happens since the Inference API is loading the model in the server. You get some benefits afterward:\n\n* The inference will be much faster.\n* The server caches your requests.\n* You get built-in automatic scaling.\n\n## Hosting your Gradio demos\n\n[Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.co/spaces) allows anyone to host their Gradio demos freely, and uploading your Gradio demos take a couple of minutes. You can head to [hf.co/new-space](https://huggingface.co/new-space), select the Gradio SDK, create an `app.py` file, and voila! You have a demo you can share with anyone else. To learn more, read [this guide how to host on Hugging Face Spaces using the website](https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-spaces).\n\n\nAlternatively, you can create a Space programmatically, making use of the [huggingface_hub client library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index) library. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom huggingface_hub import (\n    create_repo,\n    get_full_repo_name,\n    upload_file,\n)\ncreate_repo(name=target_space_name, token=hf_token, repo_type=\"space\", space_sdk=\"gradio\")\nrepo_name = get_full_repo_name(model_id=target_space_name, token=hf_token)\nfile_url = upload_file(\n    path_or_fileobj=\"file.txt\",\n    path_in_repo=\"app.py\",\n    repo_id=repo_name,\n    repo_type=\"space\",\n    token=hf_token,\n)\n```\nHere, `create_repo` creates a gradio repo with the target name under a specific account using that account's Write Token. `repo_name` gets the full repo name of the related repo. Finally `upload_file` uploads a file inside the repo with the name `app.py`.\n\n\n\n## Embedding your Space demo on other websites\n\nThroughout this guide, you've seen many embedded Gradio demos. You can also do this on own website! The first step is to create a Hugging Face Space with the demo you want to showcase. Then, [follow the steps here to embed the Space on your website](/guides/sharing-your-app/#embedding-hosted-spaces).\n\n\n## Loading demos from Spaces\n\nYou can also use and remix existing Gradio demos on Hugging Face Spaces. For example, you could take two existing Gradio demos and put them as separate tabs and create a new demo. You can run this new demo locally, or upload it to Spaces, allowing endless possibilities to remix and create new demos!\n\nHere's an example that does exactly that:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n  with gr.Tab(\"Translate to Spanish\"):\n    gr.load(\"gradio/helsinki_translation_en_es\", src=\"spaces\")\n  with gr.Tab(\"Translate to French\"):\n    gr.load(\"abidlabs/en2fr\", src=\"spaces\")\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nNotice that we use `gr.load()`, the same method we used to load models using the Inference API. However, here we specify that the `src` is `spaces` (Hugging Face Spaces).\n\n## Recap\n\nThat's it! Let's recap the various ways Gradio and Hugging Face work together:\n\n1. You can convert a `transformers` pipeline into a Gradio demo using `from_pipeline()`\n2. You can build a demo around the Inference API without having to load the model easily using `gr.load()`\n3. You host your Gradio demo on Hugging Face Spaces, either using the GUI or entirely in Python.\n4. You can embed Gradio demos that are hosted on Hugging Face Spaces onto your own website.\n5. You can load demos from Hugging Face Spaces to remix and create new Gradio demos using `gr.load()`.\n\n\n\ud83e\udd17\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"using-hugging-face-integrations\">Using Hugging Face Integrations</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>The Hugging Face Hub is a central platform that has over 190,000 <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/models\">models</a>, 32,000 <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets\">datasets</a> and 40,000 <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces\">demos</a>, also known as Spaces. Although Hugging Face is famous for its \ud83e\udd17 transformers and diffusers libraries, the Hub also supports dozens of ML libraries, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, spaCy, and many others across a variety of domains, from computer vision to reinforcement learning.</p>\n\n<p>Gradio has multiple features that make it extremely easy to leverage existing models and Spaces on the Hub. This guide walks through these features.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"using-regular-inference-with-pipeline\">Using regular inference with <code>pipeline</code></h2>\n\n<p>First, let's build a simple interface that translates text from English to Spanish. Between the over a thousand models shared by the University of Helsinki, there is an <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\">existing model</a>, <code>opus-mt-en-es</code>, that does precisely this!</p>\n\n<p>The \ud83e\udd17 transformers library has a very easy-to-use abstraction, <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.16.2/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline\"><code>pipeline()</code></a> that handles most of the complex code to offer a simple API for common tasks. By specifying the task and an (optional) model, you can use an existing model with few lines:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline(\"translation\", model=\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\")\n\ndef predict(text):\n  return pipe(text)[0][\"translation_text\"]\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n  fn=predict, \n  inputs='text',\n  outputs='text',\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>But <code>gradio</code> actually makes it even easier to convert a <code>pipeline</code> to a demo, simply by using the <code>gradio.Interface.from_pipeline</code> methods, which skips the need to specify the input and output components:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from transformers import pipeline\nimport gradio as gr\n\npipe = pipeline(\"translation\", model=\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\")\n\ndemo = gr.Interface.from_pipeline(pipe)\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The previous code produces the following interface, which you can try right here in your browser: </p>\n\n<p><gradio-app space=\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\"></gradio-app></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"using-hugging-face-inference-api\">Using Hugging Face Inference API</h2>\n\n<p>Hugging Face has a free service called the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/inference-api\">Inference API</a>, which allows you to send HTTP requests to models in the Hub. For transformers or diffusers-based models, the API can be 2 to 10 times faster than running the inference yourself. The API is free (rate limited), and you can switch to dedicated <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/pricing\">Inference Endpoints</a> when you want to use it in production.</p>\n\n<p>Let's try the same demo as above but using the Inference API instead of loading the model yourself. Given a Hugging Face model supported in the Inference API, Gradio can automatically infer the expected input and output and make the underlying server calls, so you don't have to worry about defining the prediction function. Here is what the code would look like!</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ndemo = gr.load(\"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es\", src=\"models\")\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Notice that we just put specify the model name and state that the <code>src</code> should be <code>models</code> (Hugging Face's Model Hub). There is no need to install any dependencies (except <code>gradio</code>) since you are not loading the model on your computer.</p>\n\n<p>You might notice that the first inference takes about 20 seconds. This happens since the Inference API is loading the model in the server. You get some benefits afterward:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The inference will be much faster.</li>\n<li>The server caches your requests.</li>\n<li>You get built-in automatic scaling.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"hosting-your-gradio-demos\">Hosting your Gradio demos</h2>\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hf.co/spaces\">Hugging Face Spaces</a> allows anyone to host their Gradio demos freely, and uploading your Gradio demos take a couple of minutes. You can head to <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/new-space\">hf.co/new-space</a>, select the Gradio SDK, create an <code>app.py</code> file, and voila! You have a demo you can share with anyone else. To learn more, read <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-spaces\">this guide how to host on Hugging Face Spaces using the website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can create a Space programmatically, making use of the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index\">huggingface_hub client library</a> library. Here's an example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from huggingface_hub import (\n    create_repo,\n    get_full_repo_name,\n    upload_file,\n)\ncreate_repo(name=target_space_name, token=hf_token, repo_type=\"space\", space_sdk=\"gradio\")\nrepo_name = get_full_repo_name(model_id=target_space_name, token=hf_token)\nfile_url = upload_file(\n    path_or_fileobj=\"file.txt\",\n    path_in_repo=\"app.py\",\n    repo_id=repo_name,\n    repo_type=\"space\",\n    token=hf_token,\n)\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Here, <code>create_repo</code> creates a gradio repo with the target name under a specific account using that account's Write Token. <code>repo_name</code> gets the full repo name of the related repo. Finally <code>upload_file</code> uploads a file inside the repo with the name <code>app.py</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"embedding-your-space-demo-on-other-websites\">Embedding your Space demo on other websites</h2>\n\n<p>Throughout this guide, you've seen many embedded Gradio demos. You can also do this on own website! The first step is to create a Hugging Face Space with the demo you want to showcase. Then, <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/guides/sharing-your-app/#embedding-hosted-spaces\">follow the steps here to embed the Space on your website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"loading-demos-from-spaces\">Loading demos from Spaces</h2>\n\n<p>You can also use and remix existing Gradio demos on Hugging Face Spaces. For example, you could take two existing Gradio demos and put them as separate tabs and create a new demo. You can run this new demo locally, or upload it to Spaces, allowing endless possibilities to remix and create new demos!</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example that does exactly that:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n  with gr.Tab(\"Translate to Spanish\"):\n    gr.load(\"gradio/helsinki_translation_en_es\", src=\"spaces\")\n  with gr.Tab(\"Translate to French\"):\n    gr.load(\"abidlabs/en2fr\", src=\"spaces\")\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Notice that we use <code>gr.load()</code>, the same method we used to load models using the Inference API.

We will cover the basics of using Comet with Gradio and show you some of the ways that you can leverage Gradio's advanced features such as [Embedding with iFrames](https://www.gradio.app/guides/sharing-your-app/#embedding-with-iframes) and [State](https://www.gradio.app/docs/#state) to build some amazing model evaluation workflows.\n\nHere is a list of the topics covered in this guide.\n\n1. Logging Gradio UI's to your Comet Experiments\n2. Embedding Gradio Applications directly into your Comet Projects\n3. Embedding Hugging Face Spaces directly into your Comet Projects\n4. Logging Model Inferences from your Gradio Application to Comet\n\n\n## What is Comet?\n\n[Comet](https://www.comet.com?utm_source=gradio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gradio-integration&utm_content=gradio-docs) is an MLOps Platform that is designed to help Data Scientists and Teams build better models faster! Comet provides tooling to Track, Explain, Manage, and Monitor your models in a single place! It works with Jupyter Notebooks and Scripts and most importantly it's 100% free!\n\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst, install the dependencies needed to run these examples\n\n```shell\npip install comet_ml torch torchvision transformers gradio shap requests Pillow\n```\n\nNext, you will need to [sign up for a Comet Account](https://www.comet.com/signup?utm_source=gradio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gradio-integration&utm_content=gradio-docs). Once you have your account set up, [grab your API Key](https://www.comet.com/docs/v2/guides/getting-started/quickstart/#get-an-api-key?utm_source=gradio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gradio-integration&utm_content=gradio-docs) and configure your Comet credentials\n\nIf you're running these examples as a script, you can either export your credentials as environment variables\n\n```shell\nexport COMET_API_KEY=\"<Your API Key>\"\nexport COMET_WORKSPACE=\"<Your Workspace Name>\"\nexport COMET_PROJECT_NAME=\"<Your Project Name>\"\n```\n\nor set them in a `.comet.config` file in your working directory. You file should be formatted in the following way.\n\n```shell\n[comet]\napi_key=<Your API Key>\nworkspace=<Your Workspace Name>\nproject_name=<Your Project Name>\n```\n\nIf you are using the provided Colab Notebooks to run these examples, please run the cell with the following snippet before starting the Gradio UI. Running this cell allows you to interactively add your API key to the notebook.\n\n```python\nimport comet_ml\ncomet_ml.init()\n```\n\n## 1.

Additionally,  you can also log model inferences, such as SHAP plots, from your Gradio application to Comet.\n\nIn the following snippet, we're going to log inferences from a Text Generation model. We can persist an Experiment across multiple inference calls using Gradio's [State](https://www.gradio.app/docs/#state) object.

ONNX is supported by a community of partners who have implemented it in many frameworks and tools. For example, if you have trained a model in TensorFlow or PyTorch, you can convert it to ONNX easily, and from there run it on a variety of devices using an engine/compiler like ONNX Runtime.\n\nThe [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models) is a collection of pre-trained, state-of-the-art models in the ONNX format contributed by community members. Accompanying each model are Jupyter notebooks for model training and running inference with the trained model. The notebooks are written in Python and include links to the training dataset as well as references to the original paper that describes the model architecture.\n\n\n## What are Hugging Face Spaces & Gradio?\n\n### Gradio\n\nGradio lets users demo their machine learning models as a web app all in python code. Gradio wraps a python function into a user interface and the demos can be launched inside jupyter notebooks, colab notebooks, as well as embedded in your own website and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for free.\n\nGet started [here](https://gradio.app/getting_started)\n\n### Hugging Face Spaces\n\nHugging Face Spaces is a free hosting option for Gradio demos. Spaces comes with 3 SDK options: Gradio, Streamlit and Static HTML demos. Spaces can be public or private and the workflow is similar to github repos. There are over 2000+ spaces currently on Hugging Face. Learn more about spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/launch).\n\n### Hugging Face Models\n\nHugging Face Model Hub also supports ONNX models and ONNX models can be filtered through the [ONNX tag](https://huggingface.co/models?library=onnx&sort=downloads)\n\n## How did Hugging Face help the ONNX Model Zoo?\nThere are a lot of Jupyter notebooks in the ONNX Model Zoo for users to test models. Previously, users needed to download the models themselves and run those notebooks locally for testing. With Hugging Face, the testing process can be much simpler and more user-friendly. Users can easily try certain ONNX Model Zoo model on Hugging Face Spaces and run a quick demo powered by Gradio with ONNX Runtime, all on cloud without downloading anything locally. Note, there are various runtimes for ONNX, e.g., [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime), [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet).\n\n## What is the role of ONNX Runtime?\nONNX Runtime is a cross-platform inference and training machine-learning accelerator. It makes live Gradio demos with ONNX Model Zoo model on Hugging Face possible.\n\nONNX Runtime inference can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs, supporting models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras as well as classical machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. ONNX Runtime is compatible with different hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations and transforms. For more information please see the [official website](https://onnxruntime.ai/).\n\n## Setting up a Gradio Demo for EfficientNet-Lite4\n\nEfficientNet-Lite 4 is the largest variant and most accurate of the set of EfficientNet-Lite models. It is an integer-only quantized model that produces the highest accuracy of all of the EfficientNet models. It achieves 80.4% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, while still running in real-time (e.g. 30ms/image) on a Pixel 4 CPU. To learn more read the [model card](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/vision/classification/efficientnet-lite4)\n\nHere we walk through setting up a example demo for EfficientNet-Lite4 using Gradio\n\nFirst we import our dependencies and download and load the efficientnet-lite4 model from the onnx model zoo. Then load the labels from the labels_map.txt file. We then setup our preprocessing functions, load the model for inference, and setup the inference function. Finally, the inference function is wrapped into a gradio interface for a user to interact with. See the full code below.\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport cv2\nimport json\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom onnx import hub\nimport onnxruntime as ort\n\n# loads ONNX model from ONNX Model Zoo\nmodel = hub.load(\"efficientnet-lite4\")\n# loads the labels text file\nlabels = json.load(open(\"labels_map.txt\", \"r\"))\n\n# sets image file dimensions to 224x224 by resizing and cropping image from center\ndef pre_process_edgetpu(img, dims):\n    output_height, output_width, _ = dims\n    img = resize_with_aspectratio(img, output_height, output_width, inter_pol=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)\n    img = center_crop(img, output_height, output_width)\n    img = np.asarray(img, dtype='float32')\n    # converts jpg pixel value from [0 - 255] to float array [-1.0 - 1.0]\n    img -= [127.0, 127.0, 127.0]\n    img /= [128.0, 128.0, 128.0]\n    return img\n\n# resizes the image with a proportional scale\ndef resize_with_aspectratio(img, out_height, out_width, scale=87.5, inter_pol=cv2.INTER_LINEAR):\n    height, width, _ = img.shape\n    new_height = int(100. * out_height / scale)\n    new_width = int(100. * out_width / scale)\n    if height > width:\n        w = new_width\n        h = int(new_height * height / width)\n    else:\n        h = new_height\n        w = int(new_width * width / height)\n    img = cv2.resize(img, (w, h), interpolation=inter_pol)\n    return img\n\n# crops the image around the center based on given height and width\ndef center_crop(img, out_height, out_width):\n    height, width, _ = img.shape\n    left = int((width - out_width) / 2)\n    right = int((width + out_width) / 2)\n    top = int((height - out_height) / 2)\n    bottom = int((height + out_height) / 2)\n    img = img[top:bottom, left:right]\n    return img\n\n\nsess = ort.InferenceSession(model)\n\ndef inference(img):\n  img = cv2.imread(img)\n  img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)\n  \n  img = pre_process_edgetpu(img, (224, 224, 3))\n  \n  img_batch = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)\n\n  results = sess.run([\"Softmax:0\"], {\"images:0\": img_batch})[0]\n  result = reversed(results[0].argsort()[-5:])\n  resultdic = {}\n  for r in result:\n      resultdic[labels[str(r)]] = float(results[0][r])\n  return resultdic\n  \ntitle = \"EfficientNet-Lite4\"\ndescription = \"EfficientNet-Lite 4 is the largest variant and most accurate of the set of EfficientNet-Lite model.

Note, there are various runtimes for ONNX, e.g., <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime\">ONNX Runtime</a>, <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet\">MXNet</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-role-of-onnx-runtime\">What is the role of ONNX Runtime?</h2>\n\n<p>ONNX Runtime is a cross-platform inference and training machine-learning accelerator. It makes live Gradio demos with ONNX Model Zoo model on Hugging Face possible.</p>\n\n<p>ONNX Runtime inference can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs, supporting models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras as well as classical machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. ONNX Runtime is compatible with different hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations and transforms.

It is an integer-only quantized model that produces the highest accuracy of all of the EfficientNet models. It achieves 80.4% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, while still running in real-time (e.g. 30ms/image) on a Pixel 4 CPU. To learn more read the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/vision/classification/efficientnet-lite4\">model card</a></p>\n\n<p>Here we walk through setting up a example demo for EfficientNet-Lite4 using Gradio</p>\n\n<p>First we import our dependencies and download and load the efficientnet-lite4 model from the onnx model zoo. Then load the labels from the labels_map.txt file. We then setup our preprocessing functions, load the model for inference, and setup the inference function. Finally, the inference function is wrapped into a gradio interface for a user to interact with.

Gradio wraps any Python function (such as a machine learning model's inference function) into a user interface and the demos can be launched inside jupyter notebooks, colab notebooks, as well as embedded in your own website and hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for free.\n\nGet started [here](https://gradio.app/getting_started)\n\n### Hugging Face Spaces\n\nHugging Face Spaces is a free hosting option for Gradio demos. Spaces comes with 3 SDK options: Gradio, Streamlit and Static HTML demos. Spaces can be public or private and the workflow is similar to github repos. There are over 2000+ spaces currently on Hugging Face. Learn more about spaces [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/launch).\n\n\n## Setting up a Gradio Demo for JoJoGAN\n\nNow, let's walk you through how to do this on your own. We'll make the assumption that you're new to W&B and Gradio for the purposes of this tutorial. \n\nLet's get started!\n\n1. Create a W&B account\n\n    Follow [these quick instructions](https://app.wandb.ai/login) to create your free account if you don\u2019t have one already. It shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. Once you're done (or if you've already got an account), next, we'll run a quick colab. \n\n2. Open Colab Install Gradio and W&B\n\n    We'll be following along with the colab provided in the JoJoGAN repo with some minor modifications to use Wandb and Gradio more effectively. \n\n    [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mchong6/JoJoGAN/blob/main/stylize.ipynb)\n\n    Install Gradio and Wandb at the top:\n\n```sh\n\npip install gradio wandb\n```\n\n3. Finetune StyleGAN and W&B experiment tracking\n\n    This next step will open a W&B dashboard to track your experiments and a gradio panel showing pretrained models to choose from a drop down menu from a Gradio Demo hosted on Huggingface Spaces. Here's the code you need for that:\n\n    ```python\n    \n    alpha =  1.0 \n    alpha = 1-alpha\n\n    preserve_color = True \n    num_iter = 100 \n    log_interval = 50 \n\n\n    samples = []\n    column_names = [\"Reference (y)\", \"Style Code(w)\", \"Real Face Image(x)\"]\n\n    wandb.init(project=\"JoJoGAN\")\n    config = wandb.config\n    config.num_iter = num_iter\n    config.preserve_color = preserve_color\n    wandb.log(\n    {\"Style reference\": [wandb.Image(transforms.ToPILImage()(target_im))]},\n    step=0)\n\n    # load discriminator for perceptual loss\n    discriminator = Discriminator(1024, 2).eval().to(device)\n    ckpt = torch.load('models/stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pt', map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage)\n    discriminator.load_state_dict(ckpt[\"d\"], strict=False)\n\n    # reset generator\n    del generator\n    generator = deepcopy(original_generator)\n\n    g_optim = optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=2e-3, betas=(0, 0.99))\n\n    # Which layers to swap for generating a family of plausible real images -> fake image\n    if preserve_color:\n        id_swap = [9,11,15,16,17]\n    else:\n        id_swap = list(range(7, generator.n_latent))\n\n    for idx in tqdm(range(num_iter)):\n        mean_w = generator.get_latent(torch.randn([latents.size(0), latent_dim]).to(device)).unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, generator.n_latent, 1)\n        in_latent = latents.clone()\n        in_latent[:, id_swap] = alpha*latents[:, id_swap] + (1-alpha)*mean_w[:, id_swap]\n\n        img = generator(in_latent, input_is_latent=True)\n\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            real_feat = discriminator(targets)\n        fake_feat = discriminator(img)\n\n        loss = sum([F.l1_loss(a, b) for a, b in zip(fake_feat, real_feat)])/len(fake_feat)\n        \n\n        wandb.log({\"loss\": loss}, step=idx)\n        if idx % log_interval == 0:\n            generator.eval()\n            my_sample = generator(my_w, input_is_latent=True)\n            generator.train()\n            my_sample = transforms.ToPILImage()(utils.make_grid(my_sample, normalize=True, range=(-1, 1)))\n            wandb.log(\n            {\"Current stylization\": [wandb.Image(my_sample)]},\n            step=idx)\n        table_data = [\n                wandb.Image(transforms.ToPILImage()(target_im)),\n                wandb.Image(img),\n                wandb.Image(my_sample),\n            ]\n        samples.append(table_data)\n\n        g_optim.zero_grad()\n        loss.backward()\n        g_optim.step()\n\n    out_table = wandb.Table(data=samples, columns=column_names)\n    wandb.log({\"Current Samples\": out_table})\n    ```\n\nalpha =  1.0 \nalpha = 1-alpha\n\npreserve_color = True \nnum_iter = 100 \nlog_interval = 50 \n\n\nsamples = []\ncolumn_names = [\"Referece (y)\", \"Style Code(w)\", \"Real Face Image(x)\"]\n\nwandb.init(project=\"JoJoGAN\")\nconfig = wandb.config\nconfig.num_iter = num_iter\nconfig.preserve_color = preserve_color\nwandb.log(\n{\"Style reference\": [wandb.Image(transforms.ToPILImage()(target_im))]},\nstep=0)\n\n# load discriminator for perceptual loss\ndiscriminator = Discriminator(1024, 2).eval().to(device)\nckpt = torch.load('models/stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pt', map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage)\ndiscriminator.load_state_dict(ckpt[\"d\"], strict=False)\n\n# reset generator\ndel generator\ngenerator = deepcopy(original_generator)\n\ng_optim = optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=2e-3, betas=(0, 0.99))\n\n# Which layers to swap for generating a family of plausible real images -> fake image\nif preserve_color:\n    id_swap = [9,11,15,16,17]\nelse:\n    id_swap = list(range(7, generator.n_latent))\n\nfor idx in tqdm(range(num_iter)):\n    mean_w = generator.get_latent(torch.randn([latents.size(0), latent_dim]).to(device)).unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, generator.n_latent, 1)\n    in_latent = latents.clone()\n    in_latent[:, id_swap] = alpha*latents[:, id_swap] + (1-alpha)*mean_w[:, id_swap]\n\n    img = generator(in_latent, input_is_latent=True)\n\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        real_feat = discriminator(targets)\n    fake_feat = discriminator(img)\n\n    loss = sum([F.l1_loss(a, b) for a, b in zip(fake_feat, real_feat)])/len(fake_feat)\n    \n\n    wandb.log({\"loss\": loss}, step=idx)\n    if idx % log_interval == 0:\n        generator.eval()\n        my_sample = generator(my_w, input_is_latent=True)\n        generator.train()\n        my_sample = transforms.ToPILImage()(utils.make_grid(my_sample, normalize=True, range=(-1, 1)))\n        wandb.log(\n        {\"Current stylization\": [wandb.Image(my_sample)]},\n        step=idx)\n    table_data = [\n            wandb.Image(transforms.ToPILImage()(target_im)),\n            wandb.Image(img),\n            wandb.Image(my_sample),\n        ]\n    samples.append(table_data)\n\n    g_optim.zero_grad()\n    loss.backward()\n    g_optim.step()\n\nout_table = wandb.Table(data=samples, columns=column_names)\nwandb.log({\"Current Samples\": out_table})\n```\n\n4. Save, Download, and Load Model\n\n    Here's how to save and download your model.\n\n```python\n\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport torch\ntorch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True\nfrom torchvision import transforms, utils\nfrom util import *\nimport math\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\nfrom torch import nn, autograd, optim\nfrom torch.nn import functional as F\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport lpips\nfrom model import *\nfrom e4e_projection import projection as e4e_projection\n\nfrom copy import deepcopy\nimport imageio\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nfrom argparse import Namespace\nfrom e4e.models.psp import pSp\nfrom util import *\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom google.colab import files\n\ntorch.save({\"g\": generator.state_dict()}, \"your-model-name.pt\")\n\nfiles.download('your-model-name.pt') \n\nlatent_dim = 512\ndevice=\"cuda\"\nmodel_path_s = hf_hub_download(repo_id=\"akhaliq/jojogan-stylegan2-ffhq-config-f\", filename=\"stylegan2-ffhq-config-f.pt\")\noriginal_generator = Generator(1024, latent_dim, 8, 2).to(device)\nckpt = torch.load(model_path_s, map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage)\noriginal_generator.load_state_dict(ckpt[\"g_ema\"], strict=False)\nmean_latent = original_generator.mean_latent(10000)\n\ngenerator = deepcopy(original_generator)\n\nckpt = torch.load(\"/content/JoJoGAN/your-model-name.pt\", map_location=lambda storage, loc: storage)\ngenerator.load_state_dict(ckpt[\"g\"], strict=False)\ngenerator.eval()\n\nplt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 150\n\n\n\ntransform = transforms.Compose(\n    [\n        transforms.Resize((1024, 1024)),\n        transforms.ToTensor(),\n        transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)),\n    ]\n)\n\n\ndef inference(img):  \n    img.save('out.jpg')  \n    aligned_face = align_face('out.jpg')\n\n    my_w = e4e_projection(aligned_face, \"out.pt\", device).unsqueeze(0)  \n    with torch.no_grad():\n        my_sample = generator(my_w, input_is_latent=True)\n            \n    \n    npimage = my_sample[0].cpu().permute(1, 2, 0).detach().numpy()\n    imageio.imwrite('filename.jpeg', npimage)\n    return 'filename.jpeg'\n```\n\n5. Build a Gradio Demo\n\n```python\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\ntitle = \"JoJoGAN\"\ndescription = \"Gradio Demo for JoJoGAN: One Shot Face Stylization. To use it, simply upload your image, or click one of the examples to load them. Read more at the links below.\"\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    inference, \n    gr.Image(type=\"pil\"), \n    gr.Image(type=\"file\"),\n    title=title,\n    description=description\n)\n\ndemo.launch(share=True)\n```\n\n6. Integrate Gradio into your W&B Dashboard\n\n    The last step\u2014integrating your Gradio demo with your W&B dashboard\u2014is just one extra line:\n\n```python\n\ndemo.integrate(wandb=wandb)\n```\n\n    Once you call integrate, a demo will be created and you can integrate it into your dashboard or report\n\n    Outside of W&B with Web components, using the gradio-app tags allows anyone can embed Gradio demos on HF spaces directly into their blogs, websites, documentation, etc.:\n\n```html\n\n<gradio-app space=\"akhaliq/JoJoGAN\"> </gradio-app>\n```\n\n\n7. (Optional) Embed W&B plots in your Gradio App\n\n    It's also possible to embed W&B plots within Gradio apps. To do so, you can create a W&B Report of your plots and \n    embed them within your Gradio app within a `gr.HTML` block. \n\n    The Report will need to be public and you will need to wrap the URL within an iFrame like this: \n```python\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef wandb_report(url):\n    iframe = f'<iframe src={url} style=\"border:none;height:1024px;width:100%\">'\n    return gr.HTML(iframe)\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    report_url = 'https://wandb.ai/_scott/pytorch-sweeps-demo/reports/loss-22-10-07-16-00-17---VmlldzoyNzU2NzAx'\n    report = wandb_report(report_url)\n\ndemo.launch(share=True)\n```\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this brief demo of embedding a Gradio demo to a W&B report! Thanks for making it to the end. To recap:\n\n* Only one single reference image is needed for fine-tuning JoJoGAN which usually takes about 1 minute on a GPU in colab. After training, style can be applied to any input image. Read more in the paper.\n\n* W&B tracks experiments with just a few lines of code added to a colab and you can visualize, sort, and understand your experiments in a single, centralized dashboard.\n\n* Gradio, meanwhile, demos the model in a user friendly interface to share anywhere on the web. \n\n## How to contribute Gradio demos on HF spaces on the Wandb organization\n\n* Create an account on Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/join).\n* Add Gradio Demo under your username, see this [course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter9/4?fw=pt) for setting up Gradio Demo on Hugging Face. \n* Request to join wandb organization [here](https://huggingface.co/wandb).\n* Once approved transfer model from your username to Wandb organization\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"gradio-and-wb-integration\">Gradio and W&amp;B Integration</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>In this Guide, we'll walk you through:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of Gradio, and Hugging Face Spaces, and Wandb</li>\n<li>How to setup a Gradio demo using the Wandb integration for JoJoGAN</li>\n<li>How to contribute your own Gradio demos after tracking your experiments on wandb to the Wandb organization on Hugging Face</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's an example of an model trained and experiments tracked on wandb, try out the JoJoGAN demo below.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://akhaliq-jojogan.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"810\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-wandb\">What is Wandb?</h2>\n\n<p>Weights and Biases (W&amp;B) allows data scientists and machine learning scientists to track their machine learning experiments at every stage, from training to production.

We will be using a pretrained image classification model, so you should also have `torch` installed.\n\n## Step 1 \u2014 Setting up the Image Classification Model\n\nFirst, we will need an image classification model. For this tutorial, we will use a pretrained Resnet-18 model, as it is easily downloadable from [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/). You can use a different pretrained model or train your own. \n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nmodel = torch.hub.load('pytorch/vision:v0.6.0', 'resnet18', pretrained=True).eval()\n```\n\nBecause we will be using the model for inference, we have called the `.eval()` method.\n\n## Step 2 \u2014 Defining a `predict` function\n\nNext, we will need to define a function that takes in the *user input*, which in this case is an image, and returns the prediction. The prediction should be returned as a dictionary whose keys are class name and values are confidence probabilities. We will load the class names from this [text file](https://git.io/JJkYN).\n\nIn the case of our pretrained model, it will look like this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom torchvision import transforms\n\n# Download human-readable labels for ImageNet.\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://git.io/JJkYN\")\nlabels = response.text.split(\"\\n\")\n\ndef predict(inp):\n  inp = transforms.ToTensor()(inp).unsqueeze(0)\n  with torch.no_grad():\n    prediction = torch.nn.functional.softmax(model(inp)[0], dim=0)\n    confidences = {labels[i]: float(prediction[i]) for i in range(1000)}    \n  return confidences\n```\n\nLet's break this down. The function takes one parameter:\n\n* `inp`: the input image as a `PIL` image\n\nThen, the function converts the image to a PIL Image and then eventually a PyTorch `tensor`, passes it through the model, and returns:\n\n* `confidences`: the predictions, as a dictionary whose keys are class labels and whose values are confidence probabilities\n\n## Step 3 \u2014 Creating a Gradio Interface\n\nNow that we have our predictive function set up, we can create a Gradio Interface around it. \n\nIn this case, the input component is a drag-and-drop image component. To create this input, we use `Image(type=\"pil\")` which creates the component and handles the preprocessing to convert that to a `PIL` image. \n\nThe output component will be a `Label`, which displays the top labels in a nice form. Since we don't want to show all 1,000 class labels, we will customize it to show only the top 3 images by constructing it as `Label(num_top_classes=3)`.\n\nFinally, we'll add one more parameter, the `examples`, which allows us to prepopulate our interfaces with a few predefined examples. The code for Gradio looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ngr.Interface(fn=predict, \n             inputs=gr.Image(type=\"pil\"),\n             outputs=gr.Label(num_top_classes=3),\n             examples=[\"lion.jpg\", \"cheetah.jpg\"]).launch()\n```\n\nThis produces the following interface, which you can try right here in your browser (try uploading your own examples!):\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-pytorch-image-classifier.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"660\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n----------\n\nAnd you're done! That's all the code you need to build a web demo for an image classifier. If you'd like to share with others, try setting `share=True` when you `launch()` the Interface!\n\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"image-classification-in-pytorch\">Image Classification in PyTorch</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Image classification is a central task in computer vision.

We will be using a pretrained Keras image classification model, so you should also have `tensorflow` installed.\n\n## Step 1 \u2014 Setting up the Image Classification Model\n\nFirst, we will need an image classification model. For this tutorial, we will use a pretrained Mobile Net model, as it is easily downloadable from [Keras](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/). You can use a different pretrained model or train your own. \n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninception_net = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2()\n```\n\nThis line automatically downloads the MobileNet model and weights using the Keras library.  \n\n## Step 2 \u2014 Defining a `predict` function\n\nNext, we will need to define a function that takes in the *user input*, which in this case is an image, and returns the prediction. The prediction should be returned as a dictionary whose keys are class name and values are confidence probabilities. We will load the class names from this [text file](https://git.io/JJkYN).\n\nIn the case of our pretrained model, it will look like this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Download human-readable labels for ImageNet.\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://git.io/JJkYN\")\nlabels = response.text.split(\"\\n\")\n\ndef classify_image(inp):\n  inp = inp.reshape((-1, 224, 224, 3))\n  inp = tf.keras.applications.mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input(inp)\n  prediction = inception_net.predict(inp).flatten()\n  confidences = {labels[i]: float(prediction[i]) for i in range(1000)}\n  return confidences\n```\n\nLet's break this down. The function takes one parameter:\n\n* `inp`: the input image as a `numpy` array\n\nThen, the function adds a batch dimension, passes it through the model, and returns:\n\n* `confidences`: the predictions, as a dictionary whose keys are class labels and whose values are confidence probabilities\n\n## Step 3 \u2014 Creating a Gradio Interface\n\nNow that we have our predictive function set up, we can create a Gradio Interface around it. \n\nIn this case, the input component is a drag-and-drop image component. To create this input, we can use the `\"gradio.inputs.Image\"` class, which creates the component and handles the preprocessing to convert that to a numpy array. We will instantiate the class with a parameter that automatically preprocesses the input image to be 224 pixels by 224 pixels, which is the size that MobileNet expects.\n\nThe output component will be a `\"label\"`, which displays the top labels in a nice form. Since we don't want to show all 1,000 class labels, we will customize it to show only the top 3 images.\n\nFinally, we'll add one more parameter, the `examples`, which allows us to prepopulate our interfaces with a few predefined examples. The code for Gradio looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ngr.Interface(fn=classify_image, \n             inputs=gr.Image(shape=(224, 224)),\n             outputs=gr.Label(num_top_classes=3),\n             examples=[\"banana.jpg\", \"car.jpg\"]).launch()\n```\n\nThis produces the following interface, which you can try right here in your browser (try uploading your own examples!):\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-keras-image-classifier.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"660\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n----------\n\nAnd you're done!

We will be\nconnecting to a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS but gradio is completely agnostic to the type of\ndatabase you are connecting to and where it's hosted. So as long as you can write python code to connect\nto your data, you can display it in a web UI with gradio \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## Overview \n    \nWe will be analyzing bike share data from Chicago. The data is hosted on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/cyclistic-bike-share?select=202203-divvy-tripdata.csv).\nOur goal is to create a dashboard that will enable our business stakeholders to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Are electric bikes more popular than regular bikes?\n2. What are the top 5 most popular departure bike stations?\n\nAt the end of this guide, we will have a functioning application that looks like this:\n\n<gradio-app space=\"gradio/chicago-bike-share-dashboard\"> </gradio-app>\n\n\n## Step 1 - Creating your database\n\nWe will be storing our data on a PostgreSQL hosted on Amazon's RDS service. Create an AWS account if you don't already have one\nand create a PostgreSQL database on the free tier. \n\n**Important**: If you plan to host this demo on HuggingFace Spaces, make sure database is on port **8080**. Spaces will\nblock all outgoing connections unless they are made to port 80, 443, or 8080 as noted [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#networking).\nRDS will not let you create a postgreSQL instance on ports 80 or 443.\n\nOnce your database is created, download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to your database.\nFor the sake of this demo, we will only upload March 2022 data.\n\n\n## Step 2.a - Write your ETL code\nWe will be querying our database for the total count of rides split by the type of bicycle (electric, standard, or docked).\nWe will also query for the total count of rides that depart from each station and take the top 5. \n\nWe will then take the result of our queries and visualize them in with matplotlib.\n\nWe will use the pandas [read_sql](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_sql.html)\nmethod to connect to the database. This requires the `psycopg2` library to be installed. \n\nIn order to connect to our database, we will specify the database username, password, and host as environment variables.\nThis will make our app more secure by avoiding storing sensitive information as plain text in our application files.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nDB_USER = os.getenv(\"DB_USER\")\nDB_PASSWORD = os.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\")\nDB_HOST = os.getenv(\"DB_HOST\")\nPORT = 8080\nDB_NAME = \"bikeshare\"\n\nconnection_string = f\"postgresql://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}?port={PORT}&dbname={DB_NAME}\"\n\ndef get_count_ride_type():\n    df = pd.read_sql(\n    \"\"\"\n        SELECT COUNT(ride_id) as n, rideable_type\n        FROM rides\n        GROUP BY rideable_type\n        ORDER BY n DESC\n    \"\"\",\n    con=connection_string\n    )\n    fig_m, ax = plt.subplots()\n    ax.bar(x=df['rideable_type'], height=df['n'])\n    ax.set_title(\"Number of rides by bycycle type\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Number of Rides\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Bicycle Type\")\n    return fig_m\n\n\ndef get_most_popular_stations():\n    \n    df = pd.read_sql(\n        \"\"\"\n    SELECT COUNT(ride_id) as n, MAX(start_station_name) as station\n    FROM RIDES\n    WHERE start_station_name is NOT NULL\n    GROUP BY start_station_id\n    ORDER BY n DESC\n    LIMIT 5\n    \"\"\",\n    con=connection_string\n    )\n    fig_m, ax = plt.subplots()\n    ax.bar(x=df['station'], height=df['n'])\n    ax.set_title(\"Most popular stations\")\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Number of Rides\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Station Name\")\n    ax.set_xticklabels(\n        df['station'], rotation=45, ha=\"right\", rotation_mode=\"anchor\"\n    )\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", labelsize=8)\n    fig_m.tight_layout()\n    return fig_m\n```\n\nIf you were to run our script locally, you could pass in your credentials as environment variables like so\n\n```bash\nDB_USER='username' DB_PASSWORD='password' DB_HOST='host' python app.py\n```\n\n\n## Step 2.c - Write your gradio app\nWe will display or matplotlib plots in two separate `gr.Plot` components displayed side by side using `gr.Row()`.\nBecause we have wrapped our function to fetch the data in a `demo.load()` event trigger,\nour demo will fetch the latest data **dynamically** from the database each time the web page loads. \ud83e\ude84\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        bike_type = gr.Plot()\n        station = gr.Plot()\n\n    demo.load(get_count_ride_type, inputs=None, outputs=bike_type)\n    demo.load(get_most_popular_stations, inputs=None, outputs=station)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n## Step 3 - Deployment\nIf you run the code above, your app will start running locally.\nYou can even get a temporary shareable link by passing the `share=True` parameter to `launch`.\n\nBut what if you want to a permanent deployment solution?\nLet's deploy our Gradio app to the free HuggingFace Spaces platform.\n\nIf you haven't used Spaces before, follow the previous guide [here](/using_hugging_face_integrations).\nYou will have to add the `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_HOST` variables as \"Repo Secrets\".

It is a serverless and highly scalable data warehousing solution that enables users to analyze data [using SQL-like queries](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/google-bigquery-the/9781492044451/ch01.html).\n\nIn this tutorial, we will show you how to query a BigQuery dataset in Python and display the data in a dashboard that updates in real time using `gradio`. The dashboard will look like this:\n\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/bigquery-dashboard.gif\">\n\nWe'll cover the following steps in this Guide:\n\n1. Setting up your BigQuery credentials\n2. Using the BigQuery client\n3. Building the real-time dashboard (in just *7 lines of Python*)\n\nWe'll be working with the [New York Times' COVID dataset](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) that is available as a public dataset on BigQuery. The dataset, named `covid19_nyt.us_counties` contains the latest information about the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID across US counties. \n\n**Prerequisites**: This Guide uses [Gradio Blocks](/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control), so make your are familiar with the Blocks class. \n\n## Setting up your BigQuery Credentials\n\nTo use Gradio with BigQuery, you will need to obtain your BigQuery credentials and use them with the [BigQuery Python client](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-bigquery/). If you already have BigQuery credentials (as a `.json` file), you can skip this section. If not, you can do this for free in just a couple of minutes.\n\n1. First, log in to your Google Cloud account and go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n\n2. In the Cloud Console, click on the hamburger menu in the top-left corner and select \"APIs & Services\" from the menu. If you do not have an existing project, you will need to create one.\n\n3. Then, click the \"+ Enabled APIs & services\" button, which allows you to enable specific services for your project. Search for \"BigQuery API\", click on it, and click the \"Enable\" button. If you see the \"Manage\" button, then the BigQuery is already enabled, and you're all set. \n\n4. In the APIs & Services menu, click on the \"Credentials\" tab and then click on the \"Create credentials\" button.\n\n5. In the \"Create credentials\" dialog, select \"Service account key\" as the type of credentials to create, and give it a name. Also grant the service account permissions by giving it a role such as \"BigQuery User\", which will allow you to run queries.\n\n6. After selecting the service account, select the \"JSON\" key type and then click on the \"Create\" button. This will download the JSON key file containing your credentials to your computer. It will look something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n \"type\": \"service_account\",\n \"project_id\": \"your project\",\n \"private_key_id\": \"your private key id\",\n \"private_key\": \"private key\",\n \"client_email\": \"email\",\n \"client_id\": \"client id\",\n \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n \"token_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\",\n \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\n \"client_x509_cert_url\":  \"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/email_id\"\n}\n```\n\n## Using the BigQuery Client\n\nOnce you have the credentials, you will need to use the BigQuery Python client to authenticate using your credentials. To do this, you will need to install the BigQuery Python client by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\npip install google-cloud-bigquery[pandas]\n```\n\nYou'll notice that we've installed the pandas add-on, which will be helpful for processing the BigQuery dataset as a pandas dataframe. Once the client is installed, you can authenticate using your credentials by running the following code:\n\n```py\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n\nclient = bigquery.Client.from_service_account_json(\"path/to/key.json\")\n```\n\nWith your credentials authenticated, you can now use the BigQuery Python client to interact with your BigQuery datasets. \n\nHere is an example of a function which queries the `covid19_nyt.us_counties` dataset in BigQuery to show the top 20 counties with the most confirmed cases as of the current day:\n\n```py\nimport numpy as np\n\nQUERY = (\n    'SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.covid19_nyt.us_counties` ' \n    'ORDER BY date DESC,confirmed_cases DESC '\n    'LIMIT 20')\n\ndef run_query():\n    query_job = client.query(QUERY)  \n    query_result = query_job.result()  \n    df = query_result.to_dataframe()\n    # Select a subset of columns \n    df = df[[\"confirmed_cases\", \"deaths\", \"county\", \"state_name\"]]\n    # Convert numeric columns to standard numpy types\n    df = df.astype({\"deaths\": np.int64, \"confirmed_cases\": np.int64})\n    return df\n```\n\n## Building the Real-Time Dashboard\n\nOnce you have a function to query the data, you can use the `gr.DataFrame` component from the Gradio library to display the results in a tabular format. This is a useful way to inspect the data and make sure that it has been queried correctly.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `gr.DataFrame` component to display the results. By passing in the `run_query` function to `gr.DataFrame`, we instruct Gradio to run the function as soon as the page loads and show the results. In addition, you also pass in the keyword `every` to tell the dashboard to refresh every hour (60*60 seconds).\n\n```py\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.DataFrame(run_query, every=60*60)\n\ndemo.queue().launch()  # Run the demo using queuing\n```\n\nPerhaps you'd like to add a visualization to our dashboard. You can use the `gr.ScatterPlot()` component to visualize the data in a scatter plot. This allows you to see the relationship between different variables such as case count and case deaths in the dataset and can be useful for exploring the data and gaining insights. Again, we can do this in real-time\nby passing in the `every` parameter. \n\nHere is a complete example showing how to use the `gr.ScatterPlot` to visualize in addition to displaying data with the `gr.DataFrame`\n\n```py\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# \ud83d\udc89 Covid Dashboard (Updated Hourly)\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        gr.DataFrame(run_query, every=60*60)\n        gr.ScatterPlot(run_query, every=60*60, x=\"confirmed_cases\", \n                        y=\"deaths\", tooltip=\"county\", width=500, height=500)\n\ndemo.queue().launch()  # Run the demo with queuing enabled\n```", "html": "<h1 id=\"creating-a-real-time-dashboard-from-bigquery-data\">Creating a Real-Time Dashboard from BigQuery Data</h1>\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery\">Google BigQuery</a> is a cloud-based service for processing very large data sets.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to read data from Supabase and plot it in **real-time** on a Gradio Dashboard.\n\n**Prerequisites:** To start, you will need a free Supabase account, which you can sign up for here: [https://app.supabase.com/](https://app.supabase.com/)\n\nIn this end-to-end guide, you will learn how to:\n\n* Create tables in Supabase\n* Write data to Supabase using the Supabase Python Client\n* Visualize the data in a real-time dashboard using Gradio\n\nIf you already have data on Supabase that you'd like to visualize in a dashboard, you can skip the first two sections and go directly to [visualizing the data](#visualize-the-data-in-a-real-time-gradio-dashboard)!\n\n## Create a table in Supabase\n\nFirst of all, we need some data to visualize. Following this [excellent guide](https://supabase.com/blog/loading-data-supabase-python), we'll create fake commerce data and put it in Supabase. \n\n1\\. Start by creating a new project in Supabase. Once you're logged in, click the \"New Project\" button\n\n2\\. Give your project a name and database password. You can also choose a pricing plan (for our purposes, the Free Tier is sufficient!)\n\n3\\. You'll be presented with your API keys while the database spins up (can take up to 2 minutes). \n\n4\\. Click on \"Table Editor\" (the table icon) in the left pane to create a new table. We'll create a single table called `Product`, with the following schema:\n\n<center>\n<table>\n<tr><td>product_id</td><td>int8</td></tr>\n<tr><td>inventory_count</td><td>int8</td></tr>\n<tr><td>price</td><td>float8</td></tr>\n<tr><td>product_name</td><td>varchar</td></tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n\n5\\. Click Save to save the table schema. \n\n\nOur table is now ready!\n\n\n## Write data to Supabase\n\nThe next step is to write data to a Supabase dataset. We will use the Supabase Python library to do this. \n\n6\\. Install `supabase` by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npip install supabase\n```\n\n7\\. Get your project URL and API key. Click the Settings (gear icon) on the left pane and click 'API'. The URL is listed in the Project URL box, while the API key is listed in Project API keys (with the tags `service_role`, `secret`)\n\n8\\. Now, run the following Python script to write some fake data to the table (note you have to put the values of `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` from step 7): \n\n```python\nimport supabase\n\n# Initialize the Supabase client\nclient = supabase.create_client('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY')\n\n# Define the data to write\nimport random\n\nmain_list = []\nfor i in range(10):\n    value = {'product_id': i, \n             'product_name': f\"Item {i}\",\n             'inventory_count': random.randint(1, 100), \n             'price': random.random()*100\n            }\n    main_list.append(value)\n\n# Write the data to the table\ndata = client.table('Product').insert(main_list).execute()\n```\n\nReturn to your Supabase dashboard and refresh the page, you should now see 10 rows populated in the `Product` table!\n\n## Visualize the Data in a Real-Time Gradio Dashboard\n\nFinally, we will read the data from the Supabase dataset using the same `supabase` Python library and create a realtime dashboard using `gradio`. \n\nNote: We repeat certain steps in this section (like creating the Supabase client) in case you did not go through the previous sections. As described in Step 7, you will need the project URL and API Key for your database.\n\n9\\. Write a function that loads the data from the `Product` table and returns it as a pandas Dataframe:\n\n\n```python\nimport supabase\nimport pandas as pd\n\nclient = supabase.create_client('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY')\n\ndef read_data():\n    response = client.table('Product').select(\"*\").execute()\n    df = pd.DataFrame(response.data)\n    return df\n```\n\n10\\. Create a small Gradio Dashboard with 2 Barplots that plots the prices and inventories of all of the items every minute and updates in real-time:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as dashboard:\n    with gr.Row():\n        gr.BarPlot(read_data, x=\"product_id\", y=\"price\", title=\"Prices\", every=60)\n        gr.BarPlot(read_data, x=\"product_id\", y=\"inventory_count\", title=\"Inventory\", every=60)\n\ndashboard.queue().launch()\n```\n\nNotice that by passing in a function to `gr.BarPlot()`, we have the BarPlot query the database as soon as the web app loads (and then again every 60 seconds because of the `every` parameter). Your final dashboard should look something like this:\n\n<gradio-app space=\"abidlabs/supabase\"></gradio-app>\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThat's it! In this tutorial, you learned how to write data to a Supabase dataset, and then read that data and plot the results as bar plots. If you update the data in the Supabase database, you'll notice that the Gradio dashboard will update within a minute. \n\nTry adding more plots and visualizations to this example (or with a different dataset) to build a more complex dashboard!

With Gradio and pandas, it's easy to read data from public or private Google Sheets and then display the data or plot it. In this blog post, we'll build a small *real-time* dashboard, one that updates when the data in the Google Sheets updates. \n\nBuilding the dashboard itself will just be 9 lines of Python code using Gradio, and our final dashboard will look like this:\n\n<gradio-app space=\"gradio/line-plot\"></gradio-app>\n\n**Prerequisites**: This Guide uses [Gradio Blocks](/guides/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control), so make you are familiar with the Blocks class. \n\nThe process is a little different depending on if you are working with a publicly accessible or a private Google Sheet. We'll cover both, so let's get started!\n\n## Public Google Sheets\n\nBuilding a dashboard from a public Google Sheet is very easy, thanks to the [`pandas` library](https://pandas.pydata.org/):\n\n1\\. Get the URL of the Google Sheets that you want to use. To do this, simply go to the Google Sheets, click on the \"Share\" button in the top-right corner, and then click on the \"Get shareable link\" button. This will give you a URL that looks something like this:\n\n```html\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UoKzzRzOCt-FXLLqDKLbryEKEgllGAQUEJ5qtmmQwpU/edit#gid=0\n```\n\n2\\. Now, let's modify this URL and then use it to read the data from the Google Sheets into a Pandas DataFrame. (In the code below, replace the `URL` variable with the URL of your public Google Sheet):\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nURL = \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UoKzzRzOCt-FXLLqDKLbryEKEgllGAQUEJ5qtmmQwpU/edit#gid=0\"\ncsv_url = URL.replace('/edit#gid=', '/export?format=csv&gid=')\n\ndef get_data():\n    return pd.read_csv(csv_url)\n```\n\n3\\. The data query is a function, which means that it's easy to display it real-time using the the `gr.DataFrame` component, or plot it real-time using the `gr.LinePlot` component (of course, depending on the data, a different plot may be appropriate). To do this, just pass the function into the respective components, and set the `every` parameter based on how frequently (in seconds) you would like the component to refresh. Here's the Gradio code:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# \ud83d\udcc8 Real-Time Line Plot\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.DataFrame(get_data, every=5)\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.LinePlot(get_data, every=5, x=\"Date\", y=\"Sales\", y_title=\"Sales ($ millions)\", overlay_point=True, width=500, height=500)\n\ndemo.queue().launch()  # Run the demo with queuing enabled\n```\n \nAnd that's it! You have a dashboard that refreshes every 5 seconds, pulling the data from your Google Sheet.\n\n## Private Google Sheets\n\nFor private Google Sheets, the process requires a little more work, but not that much! The key difference is that now, you must authenticate yourself to authorize access to the private Google Sheets.\n\n### Authentication\n\nTo authenticate yourself, obtain credentials from Google Cloud. Here's [how to set up google cloud credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials):\n\n1\\. First, log in to your Google Cloud account and go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)\n\n2\\. In the Cloud Console, click on the hamburger menu in the top-left corner and select \"APIs & Services\" from the menu. If you do not have an existing project, you will need to create one.\n\n3\\. Then, click the \"+ Enabled APIs & services\" button, which allows you to enable specific services for your project. Search for \"Google Sheets API\", click on it, and click the \"Enable\" button. If you see the \"Manage\" button, then Google Sheets is already enabled, and you're all set. \n\n4\\. In the APIs & Services menu, click on the \"Credentials\" tab and then click on the \"Create credentials\" button.\n\n5\\. In the \"Create credentials\" dialog, select \"Service account key\" as the type of credentials to create, and give it a name. **Note down the email of the service account**\n\n6\\. After selecting the service account, select the \"JSON\" key type and then click on the \"Create\" button. This will download the JSON key file containing your credentials to your computer. It will look something like this:\n\n```json\n{\n \"type\": \"service_account\",\n \"project_id\": \"your project\",\n \"private_key_id\": \"your private key id\",\n \"private_key\": \"private key\",\n \"client_email\": \"email\",\n \"client_id\": \"client id\",\n \"auth_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\n \"token_uri\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\",\n \"auth_provider_x509_cert_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs\",\n \"client_x509_cert_url\":  \"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/email_id\"\n}\n```\n\n### Querying\n\nOnce you have the credentials `.json` file, you can use the following steps to query your Google Sheet:\n\n1\\. Click on the \"Share\" button in the top-right corner of the Google Sheet. Share the Google Sheets with the email address of the service from Step 5 of authentication subsection (this step is important!). Then click on the \"Get shareable link\" button. This will give you a URL that looks something like this:\n\n```html\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UoKzzRzOCt-FXLLqDKLbryEKEgllGAQUEJ5qtmmQwpU/edit#gid=0\n```\n\n\n2\\. Install the [`gspread` library](https://docs.gspread.org/en/v5.7.0/), which makes it easy to work with the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts) in Python by running in the terminal: `pip install gspread`\n\n3\\. Write a function to load the data from the Google Sheet, like this (replace the `URL` variable with the URL of your private Google Sheet):\n\n```python\nimport gspread\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Authenticate with Google and get the sheet\nURL = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_91Vps76SKOdDQ8cFxZQdgjTJiz23375sAT7vPvaj4k/edit#gid=0'\n\ngc = gspread.service_account(\"path/to/key.json\")\nsh = gc.open_by_url(URL)\nworksheet = sh.sheet1 \n\ndef get_data():\n    values = worksheet.get_all_values()\n    df = pd.DataFrame(values[1:], columns=values[0])\n    return df\n\n```\n\n4\\. The data query is a function, which means that it's easy to display it real-time using the the `gr.DataFrame` component, or plot it real-time using the `gr.LinePlot` component (of course, depending on the data, a different plot may be appropriate). To do this, we just pass the function into the respective components, and set the `every` parameter based on how frequently (in seconds) we would like the component to refresh. Here's the Gradio code:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# \ud83d\udcc8 Real-Time Line Plot\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.DataFrame(get_data, every=5)\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.LinePlot(get_data, every=5, x=\"Date\", y=\"Sales\", y_title=\"Sales ($ millions)\", overlay_point=True, width=500, height=500)\n\ndemo.queue().launch()  # Run the demo with queuing enabled\n```\n \nYou now have a Dashboard that refreshes every 5 seconds, pulling the data from your Google Sheet.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnd that's all there is to it! With just a few lines of code, you can use `gradio` and other libraries to read data from a public or private Google Sheet and then display and plot the data in a real-time dashboard.\n\n\n\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"creating-a-real-time-dashboard-from-google-sheets\">Creating a Real-Time Dashboard from Google Sheets</h1>\n\n<p><a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.google.com/sheets/about/\">Google Sheets</a> are an easy way to store tabular data in the form of spreadsheets.

In the \"Create credentials\" dialog, select \"Service account key\" as the type of credentials to create, and give it a name. <strong>Note down the email of the service account</strong></p>\n\n<p>6. After selecting the service account, select the \"JSON\" key type and then click on the \"Create\" button. This will download the JSON key file containing your credentials to your computer.

Write a function to load the data from the Google Sheet, like this (replace the <code>URL</code> variable with the URL of your private Google Sheet):</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gspread\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Authenticate with Google and get the sheet\nURL = 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_91Vps76SKOdDQ8cFxZQdgjTJiz23375sAT7vPvaj4k/edit#gid=0'\n\ngc = gspread.service_account(\"path/to/key.json\")\nsh = gc.open_by_url(URL)\nworksheet = sh.sheet1 \n\ndef get_data():\n    values = worksheet.get_all_values()\n    df = pd.DataFrame(values[1:], columns=values[0])\n    return df\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>4. The data query is a function, which means that it's easy to display it real-time using the the <code>gr.DataFrame</code> component, or plot it real-time using the <code>gr.LinePlot</code> component (of course, depending on the data, a different plot may be appropriate). To do this, we just pass the function into the respective components, and set the <code>every</code> parameter based on how frequently (in seconds) we would like the component to refresh. Here's the Gradio code:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# \ud83d\udcc8 Real-Time Line Plot\")\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.DataFrame(get_data, every=5)\n        with gr.Column():\n            gr.LinePlot(get_data, every=5, x=\"Date\", y=\"Sales\", y_title=\"Sales ($ millions)\", overlay_point=True, width=500, height=500)\n\ndemo.queue().launch()  # Run the demo with queuing enabled\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>You now have a Dashboard that refreshes every 5 seconds, pulling the data from your Google Sheet.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>And that's all there is to it!

The Gradio `Plot` component works with Matplotlib, Bokeh and Plotly. Plotly is what we will be working with in this guide. Plotly allows developers to easily create all sorts of maps with their geographical data. Take a look [here](https://plotly.com/python/maps/) for some examples.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe will be using the New York City Airbnb dataset, which is hosted on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data). I've uploaded it to the Hugging Face Hub as a dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gradio/NYC-Airbnb-Open-Data) for easier use and download. Using this data we will plot Airbnb locations on a map output and allow filtering based on price and location. Below is the demo that we will be building. \u26a1\ufe0f\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/map_airbnb'></gradio-app>\n\n## Step 1 - Loading CSV data \ud83d\udcbe\n\nLet's start by loading the Airbnb NYC data from the Hugging Face Hub.\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\"gradio/NYC-Airbnb-Open-Data\", split=\"train\")\ndf = dataset.to_pandas()\n\ndef filter_map(min_price, max_price, boroughs):\n    new_df = df[(df['neighbourhood_group'].isin(boroughs)) & \n            (df['price'] > min_price) & (df['price'] < max_price)]\n    names = new_df[\"name\"].tolist()\n    prices = new_df[\"price\"].tolist()\n    text_list = [(names[i], prices[i]) for i in range(0, len(names))]\n```\n\nIn the code above, we first load the csv data into a pandas dataframe. Let's begin by defining a function that we will use as the prediction function for the gradio app. This function will accept the minimum price and maximum price range as well as the list of boroughs to filter the resulting map. We can use the passed in values (`min_price`, `max_price`, and list of `boroughs`) to filter the dataframe and create `new_df`. Next we will create `text_list` of the names and prices of each Airbnb to use as labels on the map.\n\n## Step 2 - Map Figure \ud83c\udf10\n\nPlotly makes it easy to work with maps. Let's take a look below how we can create a map figure.\n\n```python\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nfig = go.Figure(go.Scattermapbox(\n            customdata=text_list,\n            lat=new_df['latitude'].tolist(),\n            lon=new_df['longitude'].tolist(),\n            mode='markers',\n            marker=go.scattermapbox.Marker(\n                size=6\n            ),\n            hoverinfo=\"text\",\n            hovertemplate='<b>Name</b>: %{customdata[0]}<br><b>Price</b>: $%{customdata[1]}'\n        ))\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    mapbox_style=\"open-street-map\",\n    hovermode='closest',\n    mapbox=dict(\n        bearing=0,\n        center=go.layout.mapbox.Center(\n            lat=40.67,\n            lon=-73.90\n        ),\n        pitch=0,\n        zoom=9\n    ),\n)\n```\n\nAbove, we create a scatter plot on mapbox by passing it our list of latitudes and longitudes to plot markers.  We also pass in our custom data of names and prices for additional info to appear on every marker we hover over. Next we use `update_layout` to specify other map settings such as zoom, and centering.\n\nMore info [here](https://plotly.com/python/scattermapbox/) on scatter plots using Mapbox and Plotly.\n\n## Step 3 - Gradio App \u26a1\ufe0f\n\nWe will use two `gr.Number` components and a `gr.CheckboxGroup` to allow users of our app to specify price ranges and borough locations. We will then use the `gr.Plot` component as an output for our Plotly + Mapbox map we created earlier.\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Column():\n        with gr.Row():\n            min_price = gr.Number(value=250, label=\"Minimum Price\")\n            max_price = gr.Number(value=1000, label=\"Maximum Price\")\n        boroughs = gr.CheckboxGroup(choices=[\"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Manhattan\", \"Bronx\", \"Staten Island\"], value=[\"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\"], label=\"Select Boroughs:\")\n        btn = gr.Button(value=\"Update Filter\")\n        map = gr.Plot()\n    demo.load(filter_map, [min_price, max_price, boroughs], map)\n    btn.click(filter_map, [min_price, max_price, boroughs], map)\n```\n\nWe layout these components using the `gr.Column` and `gr.Row` and we'll also add event triggers for when the demo first loads and when our \"Update Filter\" button is clicked in order to trigger the map to update with our new filters.\n\nThis is what the full demo code looks like:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\"gradio/NYC-Airbnb-Open-Data\", split=\"train\")\ndf = dataset.to_pandas()\n\ndef filter_map(min_price, max_price, boroughs):\n\n    filtered_df = df[(df['neighbourhood_group'].isin(boroughs)) & \n          (df['price'] > min_price) & (df['price'] < max_price)]\n    names = filtered_df[\"name\"].tolist()\n    prices = filtered_df[\"price\"].tolist()\n    text_list = [(names[i], prices[i]) for i in range(0, len(names))]\n    fig = go.Figure(go.Scattermapbox(\n            customdata=text_list,\n            lat=filtered_df['latitude'].tolist(),\n            lon=filtered_df['longitude'].tolist(),\n            mode='markers',\n            marker=go.scattermapbox.Marker(\n                size=6\n            ),\n            hoverinfo=\"text\",\n            hovertemplate='<b>Name</b>: %{customdata[0]}<br><b>Price</b>: $%{customdata[1]}'\n        ))\n\n    fig.update_layout(\n        mapbox_style=\"open-street-map\",\n        hovermode='closest',\n        mapbox=dict(\n            bearing=0,\n            center=go.layout.mapbox.Center(\n                lat=40.67,\n                lon=-73.90\n            ),\n            pitch=0,\n            zoom=9\n        ),\n    )\n\n    return fig\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Column():\n        with gr.Row():\n            min_price = gr.Number(value=250, label=\"Minimum Price\")\n            max_price = gr.Number(value=1000, label=\"Maximum Price\")\n        boroughs = gr.CheckboxGroup(choices=[\"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Manhattan\", \"Bronx\", \"Staten Island\"], value=[\"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\"], label=\"Select Boroughs:\")\n        btn = gr.Button(value=\"Update Filter\")\n        map = gr.Plot().style()\n    demo.load(filter_map, [min_price, max_price, boroughs], map)\n    btn.click(filter_map, [min_price, max_price, boroughs], map)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n## Step 4 - Deployment \ud83e\udd17\n\nIf you run the code above, your app will start running locally.\nYou can even get a temporary shareable link by passing the `share=True` parameter to `launch`.\n\nBut what if you want to a permanent deployment solution?\nLet's deploy our Gradio app to the free HuggingFace Spaces platform.\n\nIf you haven't used Spaces before, follow the previous guide [here](/using_hugging_face_integrations).\n\n## Conclusion \ud83c\udf89\n\nAnd you're all done! That's all the code you need to build a map demo.\n\nHere's a link to the demo [Map demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/map_airbnb) and [complete code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/map_airbnb/blob/main/run.py) (on Hugging Face Spaces)\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"how-to-use-the-plot-component-for-maps\">How to Use the Plot Component for Maps</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>This guide explains how you can use Gradio to plot geographical data on a map using the <code>gradio.Plot</code> component.

Throughout various stages of the tabular data science workflow, communicating your work to stakeholders or clients can be cumbersome; which prevents data scientists from focusing on what matters, such as data analysis and model building. Data scientists can end up spending hours building a dashboard that takes in dataframe and returning plots, or returning a prediction or plot of clusters in a dataset. In this guide, we'll go through how to use `gradio` to improve your data science workflows. We will also talk about how to use `gradio` and [skops](https://skops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to build interfaces with only one line of code!\n\n###\u00a0Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started).\n\n## Let's Create a Simple Interface!\n\nWe will take a look at how we can create a simple UI that predicts failures based on product information. \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport pandas as pd\nimport joblib\nimport datasets\n\n\ninputs = [gr.Dataframe(row_count = (2, \"dynamic\"), col_count=(4,\"dynamic\"), label=\"Input Data\", interactive=1)]\n\noutputs = [gr.Dataframe(row_count = (2, \"dynamic\"), col_count=(1, \"fixed\"), label=\"Predictions\", headers=[\"Failures\"])]\n\nmodel = joblib.load(\"model.pkl\")\n\n# we will give our dataframe as example\ndf = datasets.load_dataset(\"merve/supersoaker-failures\")\ndf = df[\"train\"].to_pandas()\n\ndef infer(input_dataframe):\n  return pd.DataFrame(model.predict(input_dataframe))\n  \ngr.Interface(fn = infer, inputs = inputs, outputs = outputs, examples = [[df.head(2)]]).launch()\n```\n\nLet's break down above code.\n\n* `fn`: the inference function that takes input dataframe and returns predictions.\n* `inputs`: the component we take our input with.

As an example, consider this [Hugging Face Space that transcribes audio files](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/whisper) that are recorded from the microphone.\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/whisper-screenshot.jpg)\n\nUsing the `gradio_client` library, we can easily use the Gradio as an API to transcribe audio files programmatically.\n\nHere's the entire code to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/whisper\") \nclient.predict(\"audio_sample.wav\")  \n\n>> \"This is a test of the whisper speech recognition model.\"\n```\n\nThe Gradio client works with any hosted Gradio app, whether it be an image generator, a text summarizer, a stateful chatbot, a tax calculator, or anything else! The Gradio Client is mostly used with apps hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.space), but your app can be hosted anywhere, such as your own server.\n\n**Prerequisites**: To use the Gradio client, you do *not* need to know the `gradio` library in great detail. However, it is helpful to have general familiarity with Gradio's concepts of input and output components.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you already have a recent version of `gradio`, then the `gradio_client` is included as a dependency. \n\nOtherwise, the lightweight `gradio_client` package can be installed from pip (or pip3) and is tested to work with Python versions 3.9 or higher:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install gradio_client\n```\n\n\n## Connecting to a running Gradio App\n\nStart by connecting instantiating a `Client` object and connecting it to a Gradio app that is running on Hugging Face Spaces or generally anywhere on the web.\n\n## Connecting to a Hugging Face Space\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/en2fr\")  # a Space that translates from English to French\n```\n\nYou can also connect to private Spaces by passing in your HF token with the `hf_token` parameter. You can get your HF token here: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/my-private-space\", hf_token=\"...\") \n```\n\n\n## Duplicating a Space for private use\n\nWhile you can use any public Space as an API, you may get rate limited by Hugging Face if you make too many requests. For unlimited usage of a Space, simply duplicate the Space to create a private Space,\nand then use it to make as many requests as you'd like! \n\nThe `gradio_client` includes a class method: `Client.duplicate()` to make this process simple (you'll need to pass in your [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) or be logged in using the Hugging Face CLI):\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nHF_TOKEN = os.environ.get(\"HF_TOKEN\")\n\nclient = Client.duplicate(\"abidlabs/whisper\", hf_token=HF_TOKEN) \nclient.predict(\"audio_sample.wav\")  \n\n>> \"This is a test of the whisper speech recognition model.\"\n```\n\nIf you have previously duplicated a Space, re-running `duplicate()` will *not* create a new Space. Instead, the Client will attach to the previously-created Space. So it is safe to re-run the `Client.duplicate()` method multiple times. \n\n**Note:** if the original Space uses GPUs, your private Space will as well, and your Hugging Face account will get billed based on the price of the GPU. To minimize charges, your Space will automatically go to sleep after 1 hour of inactivity. You can also set the hardware using the `hardware` parameter of `duplicate()`.\n\n\n## Connecting a general Gradio app\n\nIf your app is running somewhere else, just provide the full URL instead, including the \"http://\" or \"https://\". Here's an example of making predictions to a Gradio app that is running on a share URL:\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"https://bec81a83-5b5c-471e.gradio.live\")\n```\n\n## Inspecting the API endpoints\n\nOnce you have connected to a Gradio app, you can view the APIs that are available to you by calling the `Client.view_api()` method. For the Whisper Space, we see the following:\n\n```bash\nClient.predict() Usage Info\n---------------------------\nNamed API endpoints: 1\n\n - predict(input_audio, api_name=\"/predict\") -> value_0\n    Parameters:\n     - [Audio] input_audio: str (filepath or URL)\n    Returns:\n     - [Textbox] value_0: str (value)\n```\n\nThis shows us that we have 1 API endpoint in this space, and shows us how to use the API endpoint to make a prediction: we should call the `.predict()` method (which we will explore below), providing a parameter `input_audio` of type `str`, which is a `filepath or URL`. \n\nWe should also provide the `api_name='/predict'` argument to the `predict()` method. Although this isn't necessary if a Gradio app has only 1 named endpoint, it does allow us to call different endpoints in a single app if they are available. If an app has unnamed API endpoints, these can also be displayed by running `.view_api(all_endpoints=True)`.\n\n\n## Making a prediction\n\nThe simplest way to make a prediction is simply to call the `.predict()` function with the appropriate arguments:\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/en2fr\", api_name='/predict')\nclient.predict(\"Hello\")\n\n>> Bonjour\n```\n\nIf there are multiple parameters, then you should pass them as separate arguments to `.predict()`, like this:\n\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"gradio/calculator\")\nclient.predict(4, \"add\", 5)\n\n>> 9.0\n```\n\nFor certain inputs, such as images, you should pass in the filepath or URL to the file. Likewise, for the corresponding output types, you will get a filepath or URL returned. \n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/whisper\")\nclient.predict(\"https://audio-samples.github.io/samples/mp3/blizzard_unconditional/sample-0.mp3\")\n\n>> \"My thought I have nobody by a beauty and will as you poured. Mr. Rochester is serve in that so don't find simpus, and devoted abode, to at might in a r\u2014\"\n```\n\n\n## Running jobs asynchronously\n\nOe should note that `.predict()` is a *blocking* operation as it waits for the operation to complete before returning the prediction. \n\nIn many cases, you may be better off letting the job run in the background until you need the results of the prediction. You can do this by creating a `Job` instance using the `.submit()` method, and then later calling `.result()` on the job to get the result. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(space=\"abidlabs/en2fr\")\njob = client.submit(\"Hello\", api_name=\"/predict\")  # This is not blocking\n\n# Do something else\n\njob.result()  # This is blocking\n\n>> Bonjour\n```\n\n## Adding callbacks\n\nAlternatively, one can add one or more callbacks to perform actions after the job has completed running, like this:\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\ndef print_result(x):\n    print(\"The translated result is: {x}\")\n\nclient = Client(space=\"abidlabs/en2fr\")\n\njob = client.submit(\"Hello\", api_name=\"/predict\", result_callbacks=[print_result])\n\n# Do something else\n\n>> The translated result is: Bonjour\n\n```\n\n## Status\n\nThe `Job` object also allows you to get the status of the running job by calling the `.status()` method. This returns a `StatusUpdate` object with the following attributes: `code` (the status code, one of a set of defined strings representing the status. See the `utils.Status` class), `rank` (the current position of this job in the queue), `queue_size` (the total queue size),  `eta` (estimated time this job will complete), `success` (a boolean representing whether the job completed successfully), and `time` (the time that the status was generated). \n\n```py\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(src=\"gradio/calculator\")\njob = client.submit(5, \"add\", 4, api_name=\"/predict\")\njob.status()\n\n>> <Status.STARTING: 'STARTING'>\n```\n\n*Note*: The `Job` class also has a `.done()` instance method which returns a boolean indicating whether the job has completed.\n\n## Cancelling Jobs\n\nThe `Job` class also has a `.cancel()` instance method that cancels jobs that have been queued but not started. For example, if you run:\n\n```py\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/whisper\") \njob1 = client.submit(\"audio_sample1.wav\")  \njob2 = client.submit(\"audio_sample2.wav\")  \njob1.cancel()  # will return False, assuming the job has started\njob2.cancel()  # will return True, indicating that the job has been canceled\n```\n\nIf the first job has started processing, then it will not be canceled. If the second job\nhas not yet started, it will be successfully canceled and removed from the queue. \n\n\n## Generator Endpoints\n\nSome Gradio API endpoints do not return a single value, rather they return a series of values. You can get the series of values that have been returned at any time from such a generator endpoint by running `job.outputs()`:\n\n```py\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(src=\"gradio/count_generator\")\njob = client.submit(3, api_name=\"/count\")\nwhile not job.done():\n    time.sleep(0.1)\njob.outputs()\n\n>> ['0', '1', '2']\n```\n\nNote that running `job.result()` on a generator endpoint only gives you the *first* value returned by the endpoint. \n\nThe `Job` object is also iterable, which means you can use it to display the results of a generator function as they are returned from the endpoint. Here's the equivalent example using the `Job` as a generator:\n\n```py\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(src=\"gradio/count_generator\")\njob = client.submit(3, api_name=\"/count\")\n\nfor o in job:\n    print(o)\n\n>> 0\n>> 1\n>> 2\n```\n\nYou can also cancel jobs that that have iterative outputs, in which case the job will finish as soon as the current iteration finishes running.\n\n```py\nfrom gradio_client import Client\nimport time\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/test-yield\")\njob = client.submit(\"abcdef\")\ntime.sleep(3)\njob.cancel()  # job cancels after 2 iterations\n```", "html": "<h1 id=\"getting-started-with-the-gradio-python-client\">Getting Started with the Gradio Python client</h1>\n\n<p>The Gradio Python client makes it very easy to use any Gradio app as an API.

Likewise, for the corresponding output types, you will get a filepath or URL returned. </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/whisper\")\nclient.predict(\"https://audio-samples.github.io/samples/mp3/blizzard_unconditional/sample-0.mp3\")\n\n>> \"My thought I have nobody by a beauty and will as you poured.

You can do this by creating a <code>Job</code> instance using the <code>.submit()</code> method, and then later calling <code>.result()</code> on the job to get the result. For example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(space=\"abidlabs/en2fr\")\njob = client.submit(\"Hello\", api_name=\"/predict\")  # This is not blocking\n\n# Do something else\n\njob.result()  # This is blocking\n\n>> Bonjour\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"adding-callbacks\">Adding callbacks</h2>\n\n<p>Alternatively, one can add one or more callbacks to perform actions after the job has completed running, like this:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from gradio_client import Client\n\ndef print_result(x):\n    print(\"The translated result is: {x}\")\n\nclient = Client(space=\"abidlabs/en2fr\")\n\njob = client.submit(\"Hello\", api_name=\"/predict\", result_callbacks=[print_result])\n\n# Do something else\n\n>> The translated result is: Bonjour\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"status\">Status</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>Job</code> object also allows you to get the status of the running job by calling the <code>.status()</code> method. This returns a <code>StatusUpdate</code> object with the following attributes: <code>code</code> (the status code, one of a set of defined strings representing the status. See the <code>utils.Status</code> class), <code>rank</code> (the current position of this job in the queue), <code>queue_size</code> (the total queue size),  <code>eta</code> (estimated time this job will complete), <code>success</code> (a boolean representing whether the job completed successfully), and <code>time</code> (the time that the status was generated). </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>from gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(src=\"gradio/calculator\")\njob = client.submit(5, \"add\", 4, api_name=\"/predict\")\njob.status()\n\n>> <Status.STARTING: 'STARTING'>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><em>Note</em>: The <code>Job</code> class also has a <code>.done()</code> instance method which returns a boolean indicating whether the job has completed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cancelling-jobs\">Cancelling Jobs</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>Job</code> class also has a <code>.cancel()</code> instance method that cancels jobs that have been queued but not started. For example, if you run:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>client = Client(\"abidlabs/whisper\") \njob1 = client.submit(\"audio_sample1.wav\")  \njob2 = client.submit(\"audio_sample2.wav\")  \njob1.cancel()  # will return False, assuming the job has started\njob2.cancel()  # will return True, indicating that the job has been canceled\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>If the first job has started processing, then it will not be canceled. If the second job\nhas not yet started, it will be successfully canceled and removed from the queue. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"generator-endpoints\">Generator Endpoints</h2>\n\n<p>Some Gradio API endpoints do not return a single value, rather they return a series of values. You can get the series of values that have been returned at any time from such a generator endpoint by running <code>job.outputs()</code>:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>from gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(src=\"gradio/count_generator\")\njob = client.submit(3, api_name=\"/count\")\nwhile not job.done():\n    time.sleep(0.1)\njob.outputs()\n\n>> ['0', '1', '2']\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Note that running <code>job.result()</code> on a generator endpoint only gives you the <em>first</em> value returned by the endpoint. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>Job</code> object is also iterable, which means you can use it to display the results of a generator function as they are returned from the endpoint. Here's the equivalent example using the <code>Job</code> as a generator:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>from gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(src=\"gradio/count_generator\")\njob = client.submit(3, api_name=\"/count\")\n\nfor o in job:\n    print(o)\n\n>> 0\n>> 1\n>> 2\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>You can also cancel jobs that that have iterative outputs, in which case the job will finish as soon as the current iteration finishes running.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>from gradio_client import Client\nimport time\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/test-yield\")\njob = client.submit(\"abcdef\")\ntime.sleep(3)\njob.cancel()  # job cancels after 2 iterations\n</code></pre></div>\n", "tags": ["CLIENT", "API", "SPACES"], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client/", "contributor": null}, {"name": "getting-started-with-the-js-client", "category": "client-libraries", "pretty_category": "Client Libraries", "guide_index": 2, "absolute_index": 27, "pretty_name": "Getting Started With The Js Client", "content": "# Getting Started with the Gradio JavaScript client\n\nTags: CLIENT, API, SPACES\n\nThe Gradio JavaScript client makes it very easy to use any Gradio app as an API. As an example, consider this [Hugging Face Space that transcribes audio files](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/whisper) that are recorded from the microphone.\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/whisper-screenshot.jpg)\n\nUsing the `@gradio/client` library, we can easily use the Gradio as an API to transcribe audio files programmatically.\n\nHere's the entire code to do it:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst response = await fetch(\n  \"https://github.com/audio-samples/audio-samples.github.io/raw/master/samples/wav/ted_speakers/SalmanKhan/sample-1.wav\"\n);\nconst audio_file = await response.blob();\n\nconst app = await client(\"abidlabs/whisper\");\nconst transcription = await app.predict(\"/predict\", [audio_file]);\n\nconsole.log(transcription.data);\n// [ \"I said the same phrase 30 times.\" ]\n```\n\nThe Gradio client works with any hosted Gradio app, whether it be an image generator, a text summarizer, a stateful chatbot, a tax calculator, or anything else! The Gradio Client is mostly used with apps hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.space), but your app can be hosted anywhere, such as your own server.\n\n**Prequisites**: To use the Gradio client, you do _not_ need to know the `gradio` library in great detail. However, it is helpful to have general familiarity with Gradio's concepts of input and output components.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe lightweight `@gradio/client` package can be installed from the npm registry with a package manager of your choice and support node version 18 and above:\n\n```bash\nnpm i @gradio/client\n```\n\n## Connecting to a running Gradio App\n\nStart by connecting instantiating a `client` instance and connecting it to a Gradio app that is running on Hugging Face Spaces or generally anywhere on the web.\n\n## Connecting to a Hugging Face Space\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = client(\"abidlabs/en2fr\"); // a Space that translates from English to French\n```\n\nYou can also connect to private Spaces by passing in your HF token with the `hf_token` property of the options parameter. You can get your HF token here: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = client(\"abidlabs/my-private-space\", { hf_token=\"hf_...\" })\n```\n\n## Duplicating a Space for private use\n\nWhile you can use any public Space as an API, you may get rate limited by Hugging Face if you make too many requests. For unlimited usage of a Space, simply duplicate the Space to create a private Space, and then use it to make as many requests as you'd like!\n\nThe `@gradio/client` exports another function, `duplicate`, to make this process simple (you'll need to pass in your [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)).\n\n`duplicate` is almost identical to `client`, the only difference is under the hood:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst response = await fetch(\n  \"https://audio-samples.github.io/samples/mp3/blizzard_unconditional/sample-0.mp3\"\n);\nconst audio_file = await response.blob();\n\nconst app = await duplicate(\"abidlabs/whisper\", { hf_token: \"hf_...\" });\nconst transcription = app.predict(\"/predict\", [audio_file]);\n```\n\nIf you have previously duplicated a Space, re-running `duplicate` will _not_ create a new Space. Instead, the client will attach to the previously-created Space. So it is safe to re-run the `duplicate` method multiple times with the same space.\n\n**Note:** if the original Space uses GPUs, your private Space will as well, and your Hugging Face account will get billed based on the price of the GPU. To minimize charges, your Space will automatically go to sleep after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can also set the hardware using the `hardware` and `timeout` properties of `duplicate`'s options object like this:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = await duplicate(\"abidlabs/whisper\", {\n  hf_token: \"hf_...\",\n  timeout: 60,\n  hardware: \"a10g-small\",\n});\n```\n\n## Connecting a general Gradio app\n\nIf your app is running somewhere else, just provide the full URL instead, including the \"http://\" or \"https://\". Here's an example of making predictions to a Gradio app that is running on a share URL:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = client(\"https://bec81a83-5b5c-471e.gradio.live\");\n```\n\n## Inspecting the API endpoints\n\nOnce you have connected to a Gradio app, you can view the APIs that are available to you by calling the `client`'s `view_api` method.\n\nFor the Whisper Space, we can do this:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = await client(\"abidlabs/whisper\");\n\nconst app_info = await app.view_info();\n\nconsole.log(app_info);\n```\n\nAnd we will see the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"named_endpoints\": {\n    \"/predict\": {\n      \"parameters\": [\n        {\n          \"label\": \"text\",\n          \"component\": \"Textbox\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"returns\": [\n        {\n          \"label\": \"output\",\n          \"component\": \"Textbox\",\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"unnamed_endpoints\": {}\n}\n```\n\nThis shows us that we have 1 API endpoint in this space, and shows us how to use the API endpoint to make a prediction: we should call the `.predict()` method (which we will explore below), providing a parameter `input_audio` of type `string`, which is a url to a file.\n\nWe should also provide the `api_name='/predict'` argument to the `predict()` method. Although this isn't necessary if a Gradio app has only 1 named endpoint, it does allow us to call different endpoints in a single app if they are available. If an app has unnamed API endpoints, these can also be displayed by running `.view_api(all_endpoints=True)`.\n\n## Making a prediction\n\nThe simplest way to make a prediction is simply to call the `.predict()` method with the appropriate arguments:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = await client(\"abidlabs/en2fr\");\nconst result = await app.predict(\"/predict\", [\"Hello\"]);\n```\n\nIf there are multiple parameters, then you should pass them as an array to `.predict()`, like this:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = await client(\"gradio/calculator\");\nconst result = await app.predict(\"/predict\", [4, \"add\", 5]);\n```\n\nFor certain inputs, such as images, you should pass in a `Buffer`, `Blob` or `File` depending on what is most convenient. In node, this would be a `Buffer` or `Blob`; in a browser environment, this would be a `Blob` or `File`.\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst response = await fetch(\n  \"https://audio-samples.github.io/samples/mp3/blizzard_unconditional/sample-0.mp3\"\n);\nconst audio_file = await response.blob();\n\nconst app = await client(\"abidlabs/whisper\");\nconst result = await client.predict(\"/predict\", [audio_file]);\n```\n\n## Using events\n\nIf the API you are working with can return results over time, or you wish to access information about the status of a job, you can use the event interface for more flexibility. This is especially useful for iterative endpoints or generator endpoints that will produce a series of values over time as discreet responses.\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nfunction log_result(payload) {\n  const {\n    data: [translation],\n  } = payload;\n\n  console.log(`The translated result is: ${translation}`);\n}\n\nconst app = await client(\"abidlabs/en2fr\");\nconst job = app.submit(\"/predict\", [\"Hello\"]);\n\njob.on(\"data\", log_result);\n```\n\n## Status\n\nThe event interface also allows you to get the status of the running job by listening to the `\"status\"` event. This returns an object with the following attributes: `status` (a human readbale status of the current job, `\"pending\" | \"generating\" | \"complete\" | \"error\"`), `code` (the detailed gradio code for the job), `position` (the current position of this job in the queue), `queue_size` (the total queue size), `eta` (estimated time this job will complete), `success` (a boolean representing whether the job completed successfully), and `time` ( as `Date` object detailing the time that the status was generated).\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nfunction log_status(status) {\n  console.log(\n    `The current status for this job is: ${JSON.stringify(status, null, 2)}.`\n  );\n}\n\nconst app = await client(\"abidlabs/en2fr\");\nconst job = app.submit(\"/predict\", [\"Hello\"]);\n\njob.on(\"status\", log_status);\n```\n\n## Cancelling Jobs\n\nThe job instance also has a `.cancel()` method that cancels jobs that have been queued but not started. For example, if you run:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = await client(\"abidlabs/en2fr\");\nconst job_one = app.submit(\"/predict\", [\"Hello\"]);\nconst job_two = app.submit(\"/predict\", [\"Friends\"]);\n\njob_one.cancel();\njob_two.cancel();\n```\n\nIf the first job has started processing, then it will not be canceled but the client will no longer listen for updates (throwing away the job). If the second job has not yet started, it will be successfully canceled and removed from the queue.\n\n## Generator Endpoints\n\nSome Gradio API endpoints do not return a single value, rather they return a series of values. You can listen for these values in real time using the event interface:\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = await client(\"gradio/count_generator\");\nconst job = app.submit(0, [9]);\n\njob.on(\"data\", (data) => console.log(data));\n```\n\nThis will log out the values as they are generated by the endpoint.\n\nYou can also cancel jobs that that have iterative outputs, in which case the job will finish immediately.\n\n```js\nimport { client } from \"@gradio/client\";\n\nconst app = await client(\"gradio/count_generator\");\nconst job = app.submit(0, [9]);\n\njob.on(\"data\", (data) => console.log(data));\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  job.cancel();\n}, 3000);\n```\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"getting-started-with-the-gradio-javascript-client\">Getting Started with the Gradio JavaScript client</h1>\n\n<p>The Gradio JavaScript client makes it very easy to use any Gradio app as an API.

It will also display a gallery of generated videos.\n\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\nBefore we begin, make sure you are running Python 3.9 or later, and have the following libraries installed:\n\n* `gradio_client`\n* `fastapi`\n* `uvicorn`\n\nYou can install these libraries from `pip`: \n\n```bash\n$ pip install gradio_client fastapi uvicorn\n```\n\nYou will also need to have ffmpeg installed. You can check to see if you already have ffmpeg by running in your terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ ffmpeg version\n```\n\nOtherwise, install ffmpeg [by following these instructions](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ffmpeg).\n\n## Step 1: Write the Video Processing Function\n\nLet's start with what seems like the most complex bit -- using machine learning to remove the music from a video. \n\nLuckily for us, there's an existing Space we can use to make this process easier: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/music-separation](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/music-separation). This Space takes an audio file and produces two separate audio files: one with the instrumental music and one with all other sounds in the original clip. Perfect to use with our client! \n\nOpen a new Python file, say `main.py`, and start by importing the `Client` class from `gradio_client` and connecting it to this Space:\n\n```py\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client(\"abidlabs/music-separation\")\n\ndef acapellify(audio_path):\n    result = client.predict(audio_path, api_name=\"/predict\")\n    return result[0]\n```\n\nThat's all the code that's needed -- notice that the API endpoints returns two audio files (one without the music, and one with just the music) in a list, and so we just return the first element of the list. \n\n---\n\n**Note**: since this is a public Space, there might be other users using this Space as well, which might result in a slow experience. You can duplicate this Space with your own [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and create a private Space that only you have will have access to and bypass the queue. To do that, simply replace the first two lines above with: \n\n```py\nfrom gradio_client import Client\n\nclient = Client.duplicate(\"abidlabs/music-separation\", hf_token=YOUR_HF_TOKEN)\n```\n\nEverything else remains the same!\n\n---\n\nNow, of course, we are working with video files, so we first need to extract the audio from the video files. For this, we will be using the `ffmpeg` library, which does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to working with audio and video files. The most common way to use `ffmpeg` is through the command line, which we'll call via Python's `subprocess` module:\n\nOur video processing workflow will consist of three steps: \n\n1. First, we start by taking in a video filepath and extracting the audio using `ffmpeg`. \n2. Then, we pass in the audio file through the `acapellify()` function above.\n3. Finally, we combine the new audio with the original video to produce a final acapellified video. \n\nHere's the complete code in Python, which you can add to your `main.py` file:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef process_video(video_path):\n    old_audio = os.path.basename(video_path).split(\".\")[0] + \".m4a\"\n    subprocess.run(['ffmpeg', '-y', '-i', video_path, '-vn', '-acodec', 'copy', old_audio])\n    \n    new_audio = acapellify(old_audio)\n    \n    new_video = f\"acap_{video_path}\"\n    subprocess.call(['ffmpeg', '-y', '-i', video_path, '-i', new_audio, '-map', '0:v', '-map', '1:a', '-c:v', 'copy', '-c:a', 'aac', '-strict', 'experimental', f\"static/{new_video}\"])\n    return new_video\n```\n\nYou can read up on [ffmpeg documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) if you'd like to understand all of the command line parameters, as they are beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n\n## Step 2: Create a FastAPI app (Backend Routes)\n\nNext up, we'll create a simple FastAPI app. If you haven't used FastAPI before, check out [the great FastAPI docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). Otherwise, this basic template, which we add to `main.py`, will look pretty familiar:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, Request\nfrom fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse, RedirectResponse\nfrom fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles\nfrom fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates\n\napp = FastAPI()\nos.makedirs(\"static\", exist_ok=True)\napp.mount(\"/static\", StaticFiles(directory=\"static\"), name=\"static\")\ntemplates = Jinja2Templates(directory=\"templates\")\n\nvideos = []\n\n@app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse)\nasync def home(request: Request):\n    return templates.TemplateResponse(\n        \"home.html\", {\"request\": request, \"videos\": videos})\n\n@app.post(\"/uploadvideo/\")\nasync def upload_video(video: UploadFile = File(...)):\n    new_video = process_video(video.filename)\n    videos.append(new_video)\n    return RedirectResponse(url='/', status_code=303)\n```\n\nIn this example, the FastAPI app has two routes: `/` and `/uploadvideo/`.\n\nThe `/` route returns an HTML template that displays a gallery of all uploaded videos. \n\nThe `/uploadvideo/` route accepts a `POST` request with an `UploadFile` object, which represents the uploaded video file. The video file is \"acapellified\" via the `process_video()` method, and the output video is stored in a list which stores all of the uploaded videos in memory.\n\nNote that this is a very basic example and if this were a production app, you will need to add more logic to handle file storage, user authentication, and security considerations. \n\n## Step 3: Create a FastAPI app (Frontend Template)\n\nFinally, we create the frontend of our web application. First, we create a folder called `templates` in the same directory as `main.py`. We then create a template, `home.html` inside the `templates` folder. Here is the resulting file structure:\n\n```csv\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 templates\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 home.html\n```\n\nWrite the following as the contents of `home.html`:\n\n```html\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html>\n&lt;html>\n  &lt;head>\n    &lt;title>Video Gallery&lt;/title>\n    &lt;style>\n      body {\n        font-family: sans-serif;\n        margin: 0;\n        padding: 0;\n        background-color: #f5f5f5;\n      }\n      h1 {\n        text-align: center;\n        margin-top: 30px;\n        margin-bottom: 20px;\n      }\n      .gallery {\n        display: flex;\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\n        justify-content: center;\n        gap: 20px;\n        padding: 20px;\n      }\n      .video {\n        border: 2px solid #ccc;\n        box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n        border-radius: 5px;\n        overflow: hidden;\n        width: 300px;\n        margin-bottom: 20px;\n      }\n      .video video {\n        width: 100%;\n        height: 200px;\n      }\n      .video p {\n        text-align: center;\n        margin: 10px 0;\n      }\n      form {\n        margin-top: 20px;\n        text-align: center;\n      }\n      input[type=\"file\"] {\n        display: none;\n      }\n      .upload-btn {\n        display: inline-block;\n        background-color: #3498db;\n        color: #fff;\n        padding: 10px 20px;\n        font-size: 16px;\n        border: none;\n        border-radius: 5px;\n        cursor: pointer;\n      }\n      .upload-btn:hover {\n        background-color: #2980b9;\n      }\n      .file-name {\n        margin-left: 10px;\n      }\n    &lt;/style>\n  &lt;/head>\n  &lt;body>\n    &lt;h1>Video Gallery&lt;/h1>\n    {% if videos %}\n      &lt;div class=\"gallery\">\n        {% for video in videos %}\n          &lt;div class=\"video\">\n            &lt;video controls>\n              &lt;source src=\"{{ url_for('static', path=video) }}\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n              Your browser does not support the video tag.\n            &lt;/video>\n            &lt;p>{{ video }}&lt;/p>\n          &lt;/div>\n        {% endfor %}\n      &lt;/div>\n    {% else %}\n      &lt;p>No videos uploaded yet.&lt;/p>\n    {% endif %}\n    &lt;form action=\"/uploadvideo/\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\n      &lt;label for=\"video-upload\" class=\"upload-btn\">Choose video file&lt;/label>\n      &lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"video\" id=\"video-upload\">\n      &lt;span class=\"file-name\">&lt;/span>\n      &lt;button type=\"submit\" class=\"upload-btn\">Upload&lt;/button>\n    &lt;/form>\n    &lt;script>\n      // Display selected file name in the form\n      const fileUpload = document.getElementById(\"video-upload\");\n      const fileName = document.querySelector(\".file-name\");\n\n      fileUpload.addEventListener(\"change\", (e) => {\n        fileName.textContent = e.target.files[0].name;\n      });\n    &lt;/script>\n  &lt;/body>\n&lt;/html>\n```\n\n## Step 4: Run your FastAPI app\n\nFinally, we are ready to run our FastAPI app, powered by the Gradio Python Client!\n\nOpen up a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`. Then run the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ uvicorn main:app\n```\n\nYou should see an output that looks like this:\n\n```csv\nLoaded as API: https://abidlabs-music-separation.hf.space \u2714\nINFO:     Started server process [1360]\nINFO:     Waiting for application startup.\nINFO:     Application startup complete.\nINFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n```\n\nAnd that's it! Start uploading videos and you'll get some \"acapellified\" videos in response (might take seconds to minutes to process depending on the length of your videos). Here's how the UI looks after uploading two videos:\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/gradio-guides/acapellify.png)\n\n If you'd like to learn more about how to use the Gradio Python Client in your projects, [read the dedicated Guide](/guides/getting-started-with-the-python-client/).\n\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"building-a-fastapi-app-with-the-gradio-python-client\">Building a FastAPI App with the Gradio Python Client</h1>\n\n<p>In this blog post, we will demonstrate how to use the <code>gradio_client</code> <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"getting-started-with-the-python-client/\">Python library</a>, which enables developers to make requests to a Gradio app programmatically, by creating an example FastAPI web app. The web app we will be building is called \"Acapellify,\" and it will allow users to upload video files as input and return a version of that video without instrumental music.

For example, an LLM could use a Gradio tool to transcribe a voice recording it finds online and then summarize it for you. Or it could use a different Gradio tool to apply OCR to a document on your Google Drive and then answer questions about it.\n\nThis guide will show how you can use `gradio_tools` to grant your LLM Agent access to the cutting edge Gradio applications hosted in the world. Although `gradio_tools` are compatible with more than one agent framework, we will focus on [Langchain Agents](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/) in this guide.\n\n## Some background\n\n### What are agents?\n\nA [LangChain agent](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/agent) is a Large Language Model (LLM) that takes user input and reports an output based on using one of many tools at its disposal.\n\n### What is Gradio?\n[Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) is the defacto standard framework for building Machine Learning Web Applications and sharing them with the world - all with just python! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n## gradio_tools - An end-to-end example\n\nTo get started with `gradio_tools`, all you need to do is import and initialize your tools and pass them to the langchain agent!\n\nIn the following example, we import the `StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool` to create a good prompt for stable diffusion, the\n`StableDiffusionTool` to create an image with our improved prompt, the `ImageCaptioningTool` to caption the generated image, and\nthe `TextToVideoTool` to create a video from a prompt. \n\nWe then tell our agent to create an image of a dog riding a skateboard, but to please improve our prompt ahead of time. We also ask\nit to caption the generated image and create a video for it. The agent can decide which tool to use without us explicitly telling it.\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nif not os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"):\n    raise ValueError(\"OPENAI_API_KEY must be set\")\n\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\nfrom gradio_tools import (StableDiffusionTool, ImageCaptioningTool, StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool,\n                          TextToVideoTool)\n\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n\nllm = OpenAI(temperature=0)\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\")\ntools = [StableDiffusionTool().langchain, ImageCaptioningTool().langchain,\n         StableDiffusionPromptGeneratorTool().langchain, TextToVideoTool().langchain]\n\n\nagent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, memory=memory, agent=\"conversational-react-description\", verbose=True)\noutput = agent.run(input=(\"Please create a photo of a dog riding a skateboard \"\n                          \"but improve my prompt prior to using an image generator.\"\n                          \"Please caption the generated image and create a video for it using the improved prompt.\"))\n```\n\nYou'll note that we are using some pre-built tools that come with `gradio_tools`. Please see this [doc](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools#gradio-tools-gradio--llm-agents) for a complete list of the tools that come with `gradio_tools`.\nIf you would like to use a tool that's not currently in `gradio_tools`, it is very easy to add your own. That's what the next section will cover.\n\n## gradio_tools - creating your own tool\n\nThe core abstraction is the `GradioTool`, which lets you define a new tool for your LLM as long as you implement a standard interface:\n\n```python\nclass GradioTool(BaseTool):\n\n    def __init__(self, name: str, description: str, src: str) -> None:\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def create_job(self, query: str) -> Job:\n        pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def postprocess(self, output: Tuple[Any] | Any) -> str:\n        pass\n```\nThe requirements are:\n1. The name for your tool\n2. The description for your tool. This is crucial! Agents decide which tool to use based on their description. Be precise and be sure to include example of what the input and the output of the tool should look like.\n3. The url or space id, e.g. `freddyaboulton/calculator`, of the Gradio application. Based on this value, `gradio_tool` will create a [gradio client](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/client/python/README.md) instance to query the upstream application via API. Be sure to click the link and learn more about the gradio client library if you are not familiar with it.\n4. create_job - Given a string, this method should parse that string and return a job from the client. Most times, this is as simple as passing the string to the `submit` function of the client. More info on creating jobs [here](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/client/python/README.md#making-a-prediction)\n5. postprocess - Given the result of the job, convert it to a string the LLM can display to the user.\n6. *Optional* - Some libraries, e.g. [MiniChain](https://github.com/srush/MiniChain/tree/main), may need some info about the underlying gradio input and output types used by the tool. By default, this will return gr.Textbox() but \nif you'd like to provide more accurate info, implement the `_block_input(self, gr)` and `_block_output(self, gr)` methods of the tool. The `gr` variable is the gradio module (the result of `import gradio as gr`). It will be\nautomatically imported by the `GradiTool` parent class and passed to the `_block_input` and `_block_output` methods.\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nOnce you have created your tool, open a pull request to the `gradio_tools` repo! We welcome all contributions.\n\n## Example tool - Stable Diffusion\n\nHere is the code for the StableDiffusion tool as an example:\n\n```python\nfrom gradio_tool import GradioTool\nimport os\n\nclass StableDiffusionTool(GradioTool):\n    \"\"\"Tool for calling stable diffusion from llm\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        name=\"StableDiffusion\",\n        description=(\n            \"An image generator. Use this to generate images based on \"\n            \"text input. Input should be a description of what the image should \"\n            \"look like. The output will be a path to an image file.\"\n        ),\n        src=\"gradio-client-demos/stable-diffusion\",\n        hf_token=None,\n    ) -> None:\n        super().__init__(name, description, src, hf_token)\n\n    def create_job(self, query: str) -> Job:\n        return self.client.submit(query, \"\", 9, fn_index=1)\n\n    def postprocess(self, output: str) -> str:\n        return [os.path.join(output, i) for i in os.listdir(output) if not i.endswith(\"json\")][0]\n\n    def _block_input(self, gr) -> \"gr.components.Component\":\n        return gr.Textbox()\n\n    def _block_output(self, gr) -> \"gr.components.Component\":\n        return gr.Image()\n```\n\nSome notes on this implementation:\n1. All instances of `GradioTool` have an attribute called `client` that is a pointed to the underlying [gradio client](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/client/python#gradio_client-use-a-gradio-app-as-an-api----in-3-lines-of-python). That is what you should use\nin the `create_job` method.\n2. `create_job` just passes the query string to the `submit` function of the client with some other parameters hardcoded, i.e. the negative prompt string and the guidance scale. We could modify our tool to also accept these values from the input string in a subsequent version.\n3. The `postprocess` method simply returns the first image from the gallery of images created by the stable diffusion space. We use the `os` module to get the full path of the image.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou now know how to extend the abilities of your LLM with the 1000s of gradio spaces running in the wild!\nAgain, we welcome any contributions to the [gradio_tools](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools) library.\nWe're excited to see the tools you all build!\n\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"gradio-llm-agents\">Gradio &amp; LLM Agents \ud83e\udd1d</h1>\n\n<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are very impressive but they can be made even more powerful if we could give them skills to accomplish specialized tasks.</p>\n\n<p>The <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools\">gradio_tools</a> library can turn any <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio\">Gradio</a> application into a <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools.html\">tool</a> that an <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/agent\">agent</a> can use to complete its task.

This guide covers how to build a pictionary app (step-by-step): \n\n1. [Set up the Sketch Recognition Model](#1-set-up-the-sketch-recognition-model)\n2. [Define a `predict` function](#2-define-a-predict-function)\n3. [Create a Gradio Interface](#3-create-a-gradio-interface)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started). To use the pretrained sketchpad model, also install `torch`.\n\n## 1. Set up the Sketch Recognition Model\n\nFirst, you will need a sketch recognition model. Since many researchers have already trained their own models on the Quick Draw dataset, we will use a pretrained model in this tutorial. Our model is a light 1.5 MB  model trained by Nate Raw, that [you can download here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/quickdraw/blob/main/pytorch_model.bin). \n\nIf you are interested, here [is the code](https://github.com/nateraw/quickdraw-pytorch) that was used to train the model. We will simply load the pretrained model in PyTorch, as follows:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\n\nmodel = nn.Sequential(\n    nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, padding='same'),\n    nn.ReLU(),\n    nn.MaxPool2d(2),\n    nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, padding='same'),\n    nn.ReLU(),\n    nn.MaxPool2d(2),\n    nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 3, padding='same'),\n    nn.ReLU(),\n    nn.MaxPool2d(2),\n    nn.Flatten(),\n    nn.Linear(1152, 256),\n    nn.ReLU(),\n    nn.Linear(256, len(LABELS)),\n)\nstate_dict = torch.load('pytorch_model.bin',    map_location='cpu')\nmodel.load_state_dict(state_dict, strict=False)\nmodel.eval()\n```\n\n## 2. Define a `predict` function\n\nNext, you will need to define a function that takes in the *user input*, which in this case is a sketched image, and returns the prediction. The prediction should be returned as a dictionary whose keys are class name and values are confidence probabilities. We will load the class names from this [text file](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nateraw/quickdraw/blob/main/class_names.txt).\n\nIn the case of our pretrained model, it will look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nLABELS = Path('class_names.txt').read_text().splitlines()\n\ndef predict(img):\n    x = torch.tensor(img, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0) / 255.\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        out = model(x)\n    probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out[0], dim=0)\n    values, indices = torch.topk(probabilities, 5)\n    confidences = {LABELS[i]: v.item() for i, v in zip(indices, values)}\n    return confidences\n```\n\nLet's break this down. The function takes one parameters:\n\n* `img`: the input image as a `numpy` array\n\nThen, the function converts the image to a PyTorch `tensor`, passes it through the model, and returns:\n\n* `confidences`: the top five predictions, as a dictionary whose keys are class labels and whose values are confidence probabilities\n\n## 3. Create a Gradio Interface\n\nNow that we have our predictive function set up, we can create a Gradio Interface around it. \n\nIn this case, the input component is a sketchpad. To create a sketchpad input, we can use the convenient string shortcut, `\"sketchpad\"` which creates a canvas for a user to draw on and handles the preprocessing to convert that to a numpy array. \n\nThe output component will be a `\"label\"`, which displays the top labels in a nice form.\n\nFinally, we'll add one more parameter, setting `live=True`, which allows our interface to run in real time, adjusting its predictions every time a user draws on the sketchpad. The code for Gradio looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ngr.Interface(fn=predict, \n             inputs=\"sketchpad\",\n             outputs=\"label\",\n             live=True).launch()\n```\n\nThis produces the following interface, which you can try right here in your browser (try drawing something, like a \"snake\" or a \"laptop\"):\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-draw2.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"450\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n----------\n\nAnd you're done!

Digital assets are being listed on marketplaces for astounding amounts of money, and just about every celebrity is debuting their own NFT collection. While your crypto assets [may be taxable, such as in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/digital-currency/cryptocurrency-guide.html), today we'll explore some fun and tax-free ways to generate your own assortment of procedurally generated [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks).\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks, often known just as *GANs*, are a specific class of deep-learning models that are designed to learn from an input dataset to create (*generate!*) new material that is convincingly similar to elements of the original training set. Famously, the website [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) went viral with lifelike, yet synthetic, images of people generated with a model called StyleGAN2. GANs have gained traction in the machine learning world, and are now being used to generate all sorts of images, text, and even [music](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/)!\n\nToday we'll briefly look at the high-level intuition behind GANs, and then we'll build a small demo around a pre-trained GAN to see what all the fuss is about. Here's a peek at what we're going to be putting together:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://nimaboscarino-cryptopunks.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"855\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started). To use the pretrained model, also install `torch` and `torchvision`.\n\n## GANs: a very brief introduction\n\nOriginally proposed in [Goodfellow et al. 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), GANs are made up of neural networks which compete with the intention of outsmarting each other. One network, known as the *generator*, is responsible for generating images. The other network, the *discriminator*, receives an image at a time from the generator along with a **real** image from the training data set. The discriminator then has to guess: which image is the fake?\n\nThe generator is constantly training to create images which are trickier for the discriminator to identify, while the discriminator raises the bar for the generator every time it correctly detects a fake. As the networks engage in this competitive (*adversarial!*) relationship, the images that get generated improve to the point where they become indistinguishable to human eyes!\n\nFor a more in-depth look at GANs, you can take a look at [this excellent post on Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/a-detailed-explanation-of-gan-with-implementation-using-tensorflow-and-keras/) or this [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html). For now, though, we'll dive into a demo!\n\n## Step 1 \u2014 Create the Generator model\n\nTo generate new images with a GAN, you only need the generator model. There are many different architectures that the generator could use, but for this demo we'll use a pretrained GAN generator model with the following architecture:\n\n```python\nfrom torch import nn\n\nclass Generator(nn.Module):\n    # Refer to the link below for explanations about nc, nz, and ngf\n    # https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html#inputs\n    def __init__(self, nc=4, nz=100, ngf=64):\n        super(Generator, self).__init__()\n        self.network = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(nz, ngf * 4, 3, 1, 0, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 4),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 4, ngf * 2, 3, 2, 1, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 2),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 2, ngf, 4, 2, 0, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf, nc, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),\n            nn.Tanh(),\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, input):\n        output = self.network(input)\n        return output\n```\n\nWe're taking the generator from [this repo by @teddykoker](https://github.com/teddykoker/cryptopunks-gan/blob/main/train.py#L90), where you can also see the original discriminator model structure.\n\nAfter instantiating the model, we'll load in the weights from the Hugging Face Hub, stored at [nateraw/cryptopunks-gan](https://huggingface.co/nateraw/cryptopunks-gan):\n\n```python\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nimport torch\n\nmodel = Generator()\nweights_path = hf_hub_download('nateraw/cryptopunks-gan', 'generator.pth')\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load(weights_path, map_location=torch.device('cpu'))) # Use 'cuda' if you have a GPU available\n```\n\n## Step 2 \u2014 Defining a `predict` function\n\nThe `predict` function is the key to making Gradio work! Whatever inputs we choose through the Gradio interface will get passed through our `predict` function, which should operate on the inputs and generate outputs that we can display with Gradio output components. For GANs it's common to pass random noise into our model as the input, so we'll generate a tensor of random numbers and pass that through the model. We can then use `torchvision`'s `save_image` function to save the output of the model as a `png` file, and return the file name:\n\n```python\nfrom torchvision.utils import save_image\n\ndef predict(seed):\n    num_punks = 4\n    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n    z = torch.randn(num_punks, 100, 1, 1)\n    punks = model(z)\n    save_image(punks, \"punks.png\", normalize=True)\n    return 'punks.png'\n```\n\nWe're giving our `predict` function a `seed` parameter, so that we can fix the random tensor generation with a seed. We'll then be able to reproduce punks if we want to see them again by passing in the same seed.\n\n*Note!* Our model needs an input tensor of dimensions 100x1x1 to do a single inference, or (BatchSize)x100x1x1 for generating a batch of images. In this demo we'll start by generating 4 punks at a time.\n\n## Step 3 \u2014 Creating a Gradio interface\n\nAt this point you can even run the code you have with `predict(<SOME_NUMBER>)`, and you'll find your freshly generated punks in your file system at `./punks.png`. To make a truly interactive demo, though, we'll build out a simple interface with Gradio. Our goals here are to:\n\n* Set a slider input so users can choose the \"seed\" value\n* Use an image component for our output to showcase the generated punks\n* Use our `predict()` to take the seed and generate the images\n\nWith `gr.Interface()`, we can define all of that with a single function call:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ngr.Interface(\n    predict,\n    inputs=[\n        gr.Slider(0, 1000, label='Seed', default=42),\n    ],\n    outputs=\"image\",\n).launch()\n```\n\nLaunching the interface should present you with something like this:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://nimaboscarino-cryptopunks-1.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"365\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n## Step 4 \u2014 Even more punks!\n\nGenerating 4 punks at a time is a good start, but maybe we'd like to control how many we want to make each time. Adding more inputs to our Gradio interface is as simple as adding another item to the `inputs` list that we pass to `gr.Interface`:\n\n```python\ngr.Interface(\n    predict,\n    inputs=[\n        gr.Slider(0, 1000, label='Seed', default=42),\n        gr.Slider(4, 64, label='Number of Punks', step=1, default=10), # Adding another slider!\n    ],\n    outputs=\"image\",\n).launch()\n```\n\nThe new input will be passed to our `predict()` function, so we have to make some changes to that function to accept a new parameter:\n\n```python\ndef predict(seed, num_punks):\n    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n    z = torch.randn(num_punks, 100, 1, 1)\n    punks = model(z)\n    save_image(punks, \"punks.png\", normalize=True)\n    return 'punks.png'\n```\n\nWhen you relaunch your interface, you should see a second slider that'll let you control the number of punks!\n\n## Step 5 - Polishing it up\n\nYour Gradio app is pretty much good to go, but you can add a few extra things to really make it ready for the spotlight \u2728\n\nWe can add some examples that users can easily try out by adding this to the `gr.Interface`:\n\n```python\ngr.Interface(\n    # ...\n    # keep everything as it is, and then add\n    examples=[[123, 15], [42, 29], [456, 8], [1337, 35]],\n).launch(cache_examples=True) # cache_examples is optional\n```\n\nThe `examples` parameter takes a list of lists, where each item in the sublists is ordered in the same order that we've listed the `inputs`. So in our case, `[seed, num_punks]`. Give it a try!\n\nYou can also try adding a `title`, `description`, and `article` to the `gr.Interface`. Each of those parameters accepts a string, so try it out and see what happens \ud83d\udc40 `article` will also accept HTML, as [explored in a previous guide](/guides/key-features/#descriptive-content)!\n\nWhen you're all done, you may end up with something like this:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://nimaboscarino-cryptopunks.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"855\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\nFor reference, here is our full code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\nfrom huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nfrom torchvision.utils import save_image\nimport gradio as gr\n\nclass Generator(nn.Module):\n    # Refer to the link below for explanations about nc, nz, and ngf\n    # https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html#inputs\n    def __init__(self, nc=4, nz=100, ngf=64):\n        super(Generator, self).__init__()\n        self.network = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(nz, ngf * 4, 3, 1, 0, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 4),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 4, ngf * 2, 3, 2, 1, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 2),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 2, ngf, 4, 2, 0, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf, nc, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),\n            nn.Tanh(),\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, input):\n        output = self.network(input)\n        return output\n\nmodel = Generator()\nweights_path = hf_hub_download('nateraw/cryptopunks-gan', 'generator.pth')\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load(weights_path, map_location=torch.device('cpu'))) # Use 'cuda' if you have a GPU available\n\ndef predict(seed, num_punks):\n    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n    z = torch.randn(num_punks, 100, 1, 1)\n    punks = model(z)\n    save_image(punks, \"punks.png\", normalize=True)\n    return 'punks.png'\n\ngr.Interface(\n    predict,\n    inputs=[\n        gr.Slider(0, 1000, label='Seed', default=42),\n        gr.Slider(4, 64, label='Number of Punks', step=1, default=10),\n    ],\n    outputs=\"image\",\n    examples=[[123, 15], [42, 29], [456, 8], [1337, 35]],\n).launch(cache_examples=True)\n```\n----------\n\nCongratulations!

Famously, the website <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/\">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a> went viral with lifelike, yet synthetic, images of people generated with a model called StyleGAN2.

Here's a peek at what we're going to be putting together:</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://nimaboscarino-cryptopunks.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"855\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<p>Make sure you have the <code>gradio</code> Python package already <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/getting_started\">installed</a>. To use the pretrained model, also install <code>torch</code> and <code>torchvision</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"gans-a-very-brief-introduction\">GANs: a very brief introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Originally proposed in <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661\">Goodfellow et al. 2014</a>, GANs are made up of neural networks which compete with the intention of outsmarting each other. One network, known as the <em>generator</em>, is responsible for generating images. The other network, the <em>discriminator</em>, receives an image at a time from the generator along with a <strong>real</strong> image from the training data set. The discriminator then has to guess: which image is the fake?</p>\n\n<p>The generator is constantly training to create images which are trickier for the discriminator to identify, while the discriminator raises the bar for the generator every time it correctly detects a fake. As the networks engage in this competitive (<em>adversarial!</em>) relationship, the images that get generated improve to the point where they become indistinguishable to human eyes!</p>\n\n<p>For a more in-depth look at GANs, you can take a look at <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/a-detailed-explanation-of-gan-with-implementation-using-tensorflow-and-keras/\">this excellent post on Analytics Vidhya</a> or this <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html\">PyTorch tutorial</a>. For now, though, we'll dive into a demo!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-1-create-the-generator-model\">Step 1 \u2014 Create the Generator model</h2>\n\n<p>To generate new images with a GAN, you only need the generator model. There are many different architectures that the generator could use, but for this demo we'll use a pretrained GAN generator model with the following architecture:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from torch import nn\n\nclass Generator(nn.Module):\n    # Refer to the link below for explanations about nc, nz, and ngf\n    # https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html#inputs\n    def __init__(self, nc=4, nz=100, ngf=64):\n        super(Generator, self).__init__()\n        self.network = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(nz, ngf * 4, 3, 1, 0, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 4),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 4, ngf * 2, 3, 2, 1, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf * 2),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf * 2, ngf, 4, 2, 0, bias=False),\n            nn.BatchNorm2d(ngf),\n            nn.ReLU(True),\n            nn.ConvTranspose2d(ngf, nc, 4, 2, 1, bias=False),\n            nn.Tanh(),\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, input):\n        output = self.network(input)\n        return output\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>We're taking the generator from <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/teddykoker/cryptopunks-gan/blob/main/train.py#L90\">this repo by @teddykoker</a>, where you can also see the original discriminator model structure.</p>\n\n<p>After instantiating the model, we'll load in the weights from the Hugging Face Hub, stored at <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/nateraw/cryptopunks-gan\">nateraw/cryptopunks-gan</a>:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download\nimport torch\n\nmodel = Generator()\nweights_path = hf_hub_download('nateraw/cryptopunks-gan', 'generator.pth')\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load(weights_path, map_location=torch.device('cpu'))) # Use 'cuda' if you have a GPU available\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-2-defining-a-predict-function\">Step 2 \u2014 Defining a <code>predict</code> function</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>predict</code> function is the key to making Gradio work! Whatever inputs we choose through the Gradio interface will get passed through our <code>predict</code> function, which should operate on the inputs and generate outputs that we can display with Gradio output components. For GANs it's common to pass random noise into our model as the input, so we'll generate a tensor of random numbers and pass that through the model. We can then use <code>torchvision</code>'s <code>save_image</code> function to save the output of the model as a <code>png</code> file, and return the file name:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from torchvision.utils import save_image\n\ndef predict(seed):\n    num_punks = 4\n    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n    z = torch.randn(num_punks, 100, 1, 1)\n    punks = model(z)\n    save_image(punks, \"punks.png\", normalize=True)\n    return 'punks.png'\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>We're giving our <code>predict</code> function a <code>seed</code> parameter, so that we can fix the random tensor generation with a seed. We'll then be able to reproduce punks if we want to see them again by passing in the same seed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note!</em> Our model needs an input tensor of dimensions 100x1x1 to do a single inference, or (BatchSize)x100x1x1 for generating a batch of images. In this demo we'll start by generating 4 punks at a time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-3-creating-a-gradio-interface\">Step 3 \u2014 Creating a Gradio interface</h2>\n\n<p>At this point you can even run the code you have with <code>predict(&lt;SOME_NUMBER&gt;)</code>, and you'll find your freshly generated punks in your file system at <code>./punks.png</code>. To make a truly interactive demo, though, we'll build out a simple interface with Gradio. Our goals here are to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set a slider input so users can choose the \"seed\" value</li>\n<li>Use an image component for our output to showcase the generated punks</li>\n<li>Use our <code>predict()</code> to take the seed and generate the images</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With <code>gr.Interface()</code>, we can define all of that with a single function call:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ngr.Interface(\n    predict,\n    inputs=[\n        gr.Slider(0, 1000, label='Seed', default=42),\n    ],\n    outputs=\"image\",\n).launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Launching the interface should present you with something like this:</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://nimaboscarino-cryptopunks-1.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"365\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-4-even-more-punks\">Step 4 \u2014 Even more punks!</h2>\n\n<p>Generating 4 punks at a time is a good start, but maybe we'd like to control how many we want to make each time. Adding more inputs to our Gradio interface is as simple as adding another item to the <code>inputs</code> list that we pass to <code>gr.Interface</code>:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>gr.Interface(\n    predict,\n    inputs=[\n        gr.Slider(0, 1000, label='Seed', default=42),\n        gr.Slider(4, 64, label='Number of Punks', step=1, default=10), # Adding another slider!\n    ],\n    outputs=\"image\",\n).launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The new input will be passed to our <code>predict()</code> function, so we have to make some changes to that function to accept a new parameter:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>def predict(seed, num_punks):\n    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n    z = torch.randn(num_punks, 100, 1, 1)\n    punks = model(z)\n    save_image(punks, \"punks.png\", normalize=True)\n    return 'punks.png'\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>When you relaunch your interface, you should see a second slider that'll let you control the number of punks!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-5-polishing-it-up\">Step 5 - Polishing it up</h2>\n\n<p>Your Gradio app is pretty much good to go, but you can add a few extra things to really make it ready for the spotlight \u2728</p>\n\n<p>We can add some examples that users can easily try out by adding this to the <code>gr.Interface</code>:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>gr.Interface(\n    # ...\n    # keep everything as it is, and then add\n    examples=[[123, 15], [42, 29], [456, 8], [1337, 35]],\n).launch(cache_examples=True) # cache_examples is optional\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The <code>examples</code> parameter takes a list of lists, where each item in the sublists is ordered in the same order that we've listed the <code>inputs</code>.

Because chatbots are designed to be used directly by customers and end users, it is important to validate that chatbots are behaving as expected when confronted with a wide variety of input prompts.\n\nUsing `gradio`, you can easily build a demo of your chatbot model and share that with your users, or try it yourself using an intuitive chatbot GUI.\n\nThis tutorial will show how to make several kinds of chatbot UIs with Gradio: first a simple one to display text, second one to stream text responses, and finally a chatbot that can handle media files as well. The chatbot interface that we create will look something like this:\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_streaming'></gradio-app>\n\n**Prerequisite**: We'll be using the `gradio.Blocks` class to build our Chatbot demo.\nYou can [read the Guide to Blocks first](https://gradio.app/quickstart/#blocks-more-flexibility-and-control) if you are not already familiar with it. Also please make sure you are using the **latest version** version of Gradio: `pip install --upgrade gradio`. \n\n## A Simple Chatbot Demo\n\nLet's start with recreating the simple demo above. As you may have noticed, our bot simply randomly responds \"How are you?\", \"I love you\", or \"I'm very hungry\" to any input. Here's the code to create this with Gradio:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport random\nimport time\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()\n    msg = gr.Textbox()\n    clear = gr.ClearButton([msg, chatbot])\n\n    def respond(message, chat_history):\n        bot_message = random.choice([\"How are you?\", \"I love you\", \"I'm very hungry\"])\n        chat_history.append((message, bot_message))\n        time.sleep(2)\n        return \"\", chat_history\n\n    msg.submit(respond, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot])\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\nThere are three Gradio components here:\n\n* A `Chatbot`, whose value stores the entire history of the conversation, as a list of response pairs between the user and bot.\n* A `Textbox` where the user can type their message, and then hit enter/submit to trigger the chatbot response\n* A `ClearButton` button to clear the Textbox and entire Chatbot history\n\nWe have a single function, `respond()`, which takes in the entire history of the chatbot, appends a random message, waits 1 second, and then returns the updated chat history. The `respond()` function also clears the textbox when it returns. \n\nOf course, in practice, you would replace `respond()` with your own more complex function, which might call a pretrained model or an API, to generate a response.\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_simple'></gradio-app>\n\n\n## Add Streaming to your Chatbot\n\nThere are several ways we can improve the user experience of the chatbot above. First, we can stream responses so the user doesn't have to wait as long for a message to be generated. Second, we can have the user message appear immediately in the chat history, while the chatbot's response is being generated. Here's the code to achieve that: \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport random\nimport time\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot()\n    msg = gr.Textbox()\n    clear = gr.Button(\"Clear\")\n\n    def user(user_message, history):\n        return \"\", history + [[user_message, None]]\n\n    def bot(history):\n        bot_message = random.choice([\"How are you?\", \"I love you\", \"I'm very hungry\"])\n        history[-1][1] = \"\"\n        for character in bot_message:\n            history[-1][1] += character\n            time.sleep(0.05)\n            yield history\n\n    msg.submit(user, [msg, chatbot], [msg, chatbot], queue=False).then(\n        bot, chatbot, chatbot\n    )\n    clear.click(lambda: None, None, chatbot, queue=False)\n    \ndemo.queue()\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\n\nYou'll notice that when a user submits their message, we now *chain* three event events with `.then()`:\n\n1. The first method `user()` updates the chatbot with the user message and clears the input field. This method also makes the input field non interactive so that the user can't send another message while the chatbot is responding. Because we want this to happen instantly, we set `queue=False`, which would skip any queue had it been enabled. The chatbot's history is appended with `(user_message, None)`, the `None` signifying that the bot has not responded.\n\n2. The second method, `bot()` updates the chatbot history with the bot's response. Instead of creating a new message, we just replace the previously-created `None` message with the bot's response. Finally, we construct the message character by character and `yield` the intermediate outputs as they are being constructed. Gradio automatically turns any function with the `yield` keyword [into a streaming output interface](/guides/key-features/#iterative-outputs).\n\n3. The third method makes the input field interactive again so that users can send another message to the bot.\n\nOf course, in practice, you would replace `bot()` with your own more complex function, which might call a pretrained model or an API, to generate a response.\n\nFinally, we enable queuing by running `demo.queue()`, which is required for streaming intermediate outputs. You can try the improved chatbot by scrolling to the demo at the top of this page.\n\n## Adding Markdown, Images, Audio, or Videos\n\nThe `gr.Chatbot` component supports a subset of markdown including bold, italics, and code. For example, we could write a function that responds to a user's message, with a bold **That's cool!**, like this:\n\n```py\ndef bot(history):\n    response = \"**That's cool!**\"\n    history[-1][1] = response\n    return history\n```\n\nIn addition, it can handle media files, such as images, audio, and video. To pass in a media file, we must pass in the file as a tuple of two strings, like this: `(filepath, alt_text)`. The `alt_text` is optional, so you can also just pass in a tuple with a single element `(filepath,)`, like this:\n\n```python\ndef add_file(history, file):\n    history = history + [((file.name,), None)]\n    return history\n```\n\nPutting this together, we can create a *multimodal* chatbot with a textbox for a user to submit text and an file upload button to submit images / audio / video files. The rest of the code looks pretty much the same as before:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport random\nimport time\n\n# Chatbot demo with multimodal input (text, markdown, LaTeX, code blocks, image, audio, & video). Plus shows support for streaming text.\n\ndef add_text(history, text):\n    history = history + [(text, None)]\n    return history, gr.update(value=\"\", interactive=False)\n\n\ndef add_file(history, file):\n    history = history + [((file.name,), None)]\n    return history\n\n\ndef bot(history):\n    response = \"**That's cool!**\"\n    history[-1][1] = \"\"\n    for character in response:\n        history[-1][1] += character\n        time.sleep(0.05)\n        yield history\n\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    chatbot = gr.Chatbot([], elem_id=\"chatbot\").style(height=750)\n\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column(scale=0.85):\n            txt = gr.Textbox(\n                show_label=False,\n                placeholder=\"Enter text and press enter, or upload an image\",\n            ).style(container=False)\n        with gr.Column(scale=0.15, min_width=0):\n            btn = gr.UploadButton(\"\ud83d\udcc1\", file_types=[\"image\", \"video\", \"audio\"])\n\n    txt_msg = txt.submit(add_text, [chatbot, txt], [chatbot, txt], queue=False).then(\n        bot, chatbot, chatbot\n    )\n    txt_msg.then(lambda: gr.update(interactive=True), None, [txt], queue=False)\n    file_msg = btn.upload(add_file, [chatbot, btn], [chatbot], queue=False).then(\n        bot, chatbot, chatbot\n    )\n\ndemo.queue()\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/chatbot_multimodal'></gradio-app>\n\nAnd you're done!

The guide will be complemented by code snippets showing step by step how the [ColorPicker](https://gradio.app/docs/#colorpicker) component was added.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have followed the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide in order to setup your local development environment (both client and server side).\n\nHere's how to create a new component on Gradio:\n\n1. [Create a New Python Class and Import it](#1-create-a-new-python-class-and-import-it)\n2. [Create a New Svelte Component](#2-create-a-new-svelte-component)\n3. [Create a New Demo](#3-create-a-new-demo)\n\n## 1. Create a New Python Class and Import it\n\nThe first thing to do is to create a new class within the [components.py](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/components.py) file. This Python class should inherit from a list of base components and should be placed within the file in the correct section with respect to the type of component you want to add (e.g. input, output or static components).\nIn general, it is advisable to take an existing component as a reference (e.g. [TextBox](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/components.py#L290)), copy its code as a skeleton and then adapt it to the case at hand.\n\nLet's take a look at the class added to the [components.py](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/components.py) file for the ColorPicker component:\n\n```python\n@document()\nclass ColorPicker(Changeable, Submittable, IOComponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a color picker for user to select a color as string input.\n    Preprocessing: passes selected color value as a {str} into the function.\n    Postprocessing: expects a {str} returned from function and sets color picker value to it.\n    Examples-format: a {str} with a hexadecimal representation of a color, e.g. \"#ff0000\" for red.\n    Demos: color_picker, color_generator\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        value: str = None,\n        *,\n        label: Optional[str] = None,\n        show_label: bool = True,\n        interactive: Optional[bool] = None,\n        visible: bool = True,\n        elem_id: Optional[str] = None,\n        **kwargs,\n    ):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parameters:\n            value: default text to provide in color picker.\n            label: component name in interface.\n            show_label: if True, will display label.\n            interactive: if True, will be rendered as an editable color picker; if False, editing will be disabled. If not provided, this is inferred based on whether the component is used as an input or output.\n            visible: If False, component will be hidden.\n            elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.value = self.postprocess(value)\n        self.cleared_value = \"#000000\"\n        self.test_input = value\n        IOComponent.__init__(\n            self,\n            label=label,\n            show_label=show_label,\n            interactive=interactive,\n            visible=visible,\n            elem_id=elem_id,\n            **kwargs,\n        )\n\n    def get_config(self):\n        return {\n            \"value\": self.value,\n            **IOComponent.get_config(self),\n        }\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def update(\n        value: Optional[Any] = None,\n        label: Optional[str] = None,\n        show_label: Optional[bool] = None,\n        visible: Optional[bool] = None,\n        interactive: Optional[bool] = None,\n    ):\n        return {\n            \"value\": value,\n            \"label\": label,\n            \"show_label\": show_label,\n            \"visible\": visible,\n            \"interactive\": interactive,\n            \"__type__\": \"update\",\n        }\n\n    # Input Functionalities\n    def preprocess(self, x: str | None) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"\n        Any preprocessing needed to be performed on function input.\n        Parameters:\n        x (str): text\n        Returns:\n        (str): text\n        \"\"\"\n        if x is None:\n            return None\n        else:\n            return str(x)\n\n    def preprocess_example(self, x: str | None) -> Any:\n        \"\"\"\n        Any preprocessing needed to be performed on an example before being passed to the main function.\n        \"\"\"\n        if x is None:\n            return None\n        else:\n            return str(x)\n\n    # Output Functionalities\n    def postprocess(self, y: str | None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Any postprocessing needed to be performed on function output.\n        Parameters:\n        y (str | None): text\n        Returns:\n        (str | None): text\n        \"\"\"\n        if y is None:\n            return None\n        else:\n            return str(y)\n\n    def deserialize(self, x):\n        \"\"\"\n        Convert from serialized output (e.g. base64 representation) from a call() to the interface to a human-readable version of the output (path of an image, etc.)\n        \"\"\"\n        return x\n```\n\nOnce defined, it is necessary to import the new class inside the [\\_\\_init\\_\\_](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/__init__.py) module class in order to make it module visible.\n\n```python\n\nfrom gradio.components import (\n    ...\n    ColorPicker,\n    ...\n)\n\n```\n\n### 1.1 Writing Unit Test for Python Class\n\nWhen developing new components, you should also write a suite of unit tests for it. The tests should be placed in the [gradio/test/test_components.py](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/test/test_components.py) file. Again, as above, take a cue from the tests of other components (e.g. [Textbox](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/test/test_components.py)) and add as many unit tests as you think are appropriate to test all the different aspects and functionalities of the new component. For example, the following tests were added for the ColorPicker component:\n\n```python\nclass TestColorPicker(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_component_functions(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Preprocess, postprocess, serialize, save_flagged, restore_flagged, tokenize, get_config\n        \"\"\"\n        color_picker_input = gr.ColorPicker()\n        self.assertEqual(color_picker_input.preprocess(\"#000000\"), \"#000000\")\n        self.assertEqual(color_picker_input.preprocess_example(\"#000000\"), \"#000000\")\n        self.assertEqual(color_picker_input.postprocess(None), None)\n        self.assertEqual(color_picker_input.postprocess(\"#FFFFFF\"), \"#FFFFFF\")\n        self.assertEqual(color_picker_input.serialize(\"#000000\", True), \"#000000\")\n\n        color_picker_input.interpretation_replacement = \"unknown\"\n\n        self.assertEqual(\n            color_picker_input.get_config(),\n            {\n                \"value\": None,\n                \"show_label\": True,\n                \"label\": None,\n                \"style\": {},\n                \"elem_id\": None,\n                \"visible\": True,\n                \"interactive\": None,\n                \"name\": \"colorpicker\",\n            },\n        )\n\n    def test_in_interface_as_input(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Interface, process, interpret,\n        \"\"\"\n        iface = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, \"colorpicker\", \"colorpicker\")\n        self.assertEqual(iface.process([\"#000000\"]), [\"#000000\"])\n\n    def test_in_interface_as_output(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Interface, process\n\n        \"\"\"\n        iface = gr.Interface(lambda x: x, \"colorpicker\", gr.ColorPicker())\n        self.assertEqual(iface.process([\"#000000\"]), [\"#000000\"])\n\n    def test_static(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        postprocess\n        \"\"\"\n        component = gr.ColorPicker(\"#000000\")\n        self.assertEqual(component.get_config().get(\"value\"), \"#000000\")\n```\n\n## 2. Create a New Svelte Component\n\nLet's see the steps you need to follow to create the frontend of your new component and to map it to its python code:\n\n- Create a new UI-side Svelte component and figure out where to place it. The options are: create a package for the new component in the [js folder](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/js/), if this is completely different from existing components or add the new component to an existing package, such as to the [form package](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/js/form). The ColorPicker component for example, was included in the form package because it is similar to components that already exist.\n- Create a file with an appropriate name in the src folder of the package where you placed the Svelte component, note: the name must start with a capital letter. This is the 'core' component and it's the generic component that has no knowledge of Gradio specific functionality. Initially add any text/html to this file so that the component renders something. The Svelte application code for the ColorPicker looks like this:\n\n```typescript\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport { createEventDispatcher } from \"svelte\";\n\timport { get_styles } from \"@gradio/utils\";\n\timport { BlockTitle } from \"@gradio/atoms\";\n\timport type { Styles } from \"@gradio/utils\";\n\n\texport let value: string = \"#000000\";\n\texport let style: Styles = {};\n\texport let label: string;\n\texport let disabled = false;\n\texport let show_label: boolean = true;\n\n\t$: value;\n\t$: handle_change(value);\n\n\tconst dispatch = createEventDispatcher<{\n\t\tchange: string;\n\t\tsubmit: undefined;\n\t}>();\n\n\tfunction handle_change(val: string) {\n\t\tdispatch(\"change\", val);\n\t}\n\n\t$: ({ styles } = get_styles(style, [\"rounded\", \"border\"]));\n</script>\n\n<!-- svelte-ignore a11y-label-has-associated-control -->\n<label class=\"block\">\n\t<BlockTitle {show_label}>{label}</BlockTitle>\n\t<input\n\t\ttype=\"color\"\n\t\tclass=\"gr-box-unrounded {classes}\"\n\t\tbind:value\n\t\t{disabled}\n\t/>\n</label>\n```\n\n- Export this file inside the index.ts file of the package where you placed the Svelte component by doing `export { default as FileName } from \"./FileName.svelte\"`. The ColorPicker file is exported in the [index.ts](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/js/form/src/index.ts) file and the export is performed by doing: `export { default as ColorPicker } from \"./ColorPicker.svelte\";`.\n- Create the Gradio specific component in [js/app/src/components](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/js/app/src/components). This is a Gradio wrapper that handles the specific logic of the library, passes the necessary data down to the core component and attaches any necessary event listeners. Copy the folder of another component, rename it and edit the code inside it, keeping the structure.\n\nHere you will have three files, the first file is for the Svelte application, and it will look like this:\n\n```typescript\n<svelte:options accessors={true} />\n\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport { ColorPicker } from \"@gradio/form\";\n\timport { Block } from \"@gradio/atoms\";\n\timport StatusTracker from \"../StatusTracker/StatusTracker.svelte\";\n\timport type { LoadingStatus } from \"../StatusTracker/types\";\n\timport type { Styles } from \"@gradio/utils\";\n\n\texport let label: string = \"ColorPicker\";\n\texport let elem_id: string = \"\";\n\texport let visible: boolean = true;\n\texport let value: string;\n\texport let form_position: \"first\" | \"last\" | \"mid\" | \"single\" = \"single\";\n\texport let show_label: boolean;\n\n\texport let style: Styles = {};\n\n\texport let loading_status: LoadingStatus;\n\n\texport let mode: \"static\" | \"dynamic\";\n</script>\n\n<Block\n\t{visible}\n\t{form_position}\n\t{elem_id}\n\tdisable={typeof style.container === \"boolean\" && !style.container}\n>\n\t<StatusTracker {...loading_status} />\n\n\t<ColorPicker\n\t\t{style}\n\t\tbind:value\n\t\t{label}\n\t\t{show_label}\n\t\ton:change\n\t\ton:submit\n\t\tdisabled={mode === \"static\"}\n\t/>\n</Block>\n```\n\nThe second one contains the tests for the frontend, for example for the ColorPicker component:\n\n```typescript\nimport { test, describe, assert, afterEach } from \"vitest\";\nimport { cleanup, render } from \"@gradio/tootils\";\n\nimport ColorPicker from \"./ColorPicker.svelte\";\nimport type { LoadingStatus } from \"../StatusTracker/types\";\n\nconst loading_status = {\n\teta: 0,\n\tqueue_position: 1,\n\tstatus: \"complete\" as LoadingStatus[\"status\"],\n\tscroll_to_output: false,\n\tvisible: true,\n\tfn_index: 0\n};\n\ndescribe(\"ColorPicker\", () => {\n\tafterEach(() => cleanup());\n\n\ttest(\"renders provided value\", () => {\n\t\tconst { getByDisplayValue } = render(ColorPicker, {\n\t\t\tloading_status,\n\t\t\tshow_label: true,\n\t\t\tmode: \"dynamic\",\n\t\t\tvalue: \"#000000\",\n\t\t\tlabel: \"ColorPicker\"\n\t\t});\n\n\t\tconst item: HTMLInputElement = getByDisplayValue(\"#000000\");\n\t\tassert.equal(item.value, \"#000000\");\n\t});\n\n\ttest(\"changing the color should update the value\", async () => {\n\t\tconst { component, getByDisplayValue } = render(ColorPicker, {\n\t\t\tloading_status,\n\t\t\tshow_label: true,\n\t\t\tmode: \"dynamic\",\n\t\t\tvalue: \"#000000\",\n\t\t\tlabel: \"ColorPicker\"\n\t\t});\n\n\t\tconst item: HTMLInputElement = getByDisplayValue(\"#000000\");\n\n\t\tassert.equal(item.value, \"#000000\");\n\n\t\tawait component.$set({\n\t\t\tvalue: \"#FFFFFF\"\n\t\t});\n\n\t\tassert.equal(component.value, \"#FFFFFF\");\n\t});\n});\n```\n\nThe third one is the index.ts file:\n\n```typescript\nexport { default as Component } from \"./ColorPicker.svelte\";\nexport const modes = [\"static\", \"dynamic\"];\n```\n\n- Add the mapping for your component in the [directory.ts file](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/js/app/src/components/directory.ts). To do this, copy and paste the mapping line of any component and edit its text. The key name must be the lowercase version of the actual component name in the Python library. So for example, for the ColorPicker component the mapping looks like this:\n\n```typescript\nexport const component_map = {\n...\ncolorpicker: () => import(\"./ColorPicker\"),\n...\n}\n```\n\n### 2.1 Writing Unit Test for Svelte Component\n\nWhen developing new components, you should also write a suite of unit tests for it. The tests should be placed in the new component's folder in a file named MyAwesomeComponent.test.ts. Again, as above, take a cue from the tests of other components (e.g. [Textbox.test.ts](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/js/app/src/components/Textbox/Textbox.test.ts)) and add as many unit tests as you think are appropriate to test all the different aspects and functionalities of the new component.\n\n### 3. Create a New Demo\n\nThe last step is to create a demo in the [gradio/demo folder](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/demo), which will use the newly added component. Again, the suggestion is to reference an existing demo. Write the code for the demo in a file called run.py, add the necessary requirements and an image showing the application interface. Finally add a gif showing its usage.\nYou can take a look at the [demo](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/demo/color_picker) created for the ColorPicker, where an icon and a color selected through the new component is taken as input, and the same icon colored with the selected color is returned as output.\n\nTo test the application:\n\n- run on a terminal `python path/demo/run.py` which starts the backend at the address [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860);\n- in another terminal, run `pnpm dev` to start the frontend at [http://localhost:9876](http://localhost:9876) with hot reload functionalities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this guide, we have shown how simple it is to add a new component to Gradio, seeing step by step how the ColorPicker component was added. For further details, you can refer to PR: [#1695](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/1695).\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"how-to-create-a-new-component\">How to Create a New Component</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>The purpose of this guide is to illustrate how to add a new component, which you can use in your Gradio applications.

This Python class should inherit from a list of base components and should be placed within the file in the correct section with respect to the type of component you want to add (e.g. input, output or static components).\nIn general, it is advisable to take an existing component as a reference (e.g. <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/components.py#L290\">TextBox</a>), copy its code as a skeleton and then adapt it to the case at hand.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take a look at the class added to the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/components.py\">components.py</a> file for the ColorPicker component:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>@document()\nclass ColorPicker(Changeable, Submittable, IOComponent):\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a color picker for user to select a color as string input.\n    Preprocessing: passes selected color value as a {str} into the function.\n    Postprocessing: expects a {str} returned from function and sets color picker value to it.\n    Examples-format: a {str} with a hexadecimal representation of a color, e.g. \"#ff0000\" for red.\n    Demos: color_picker, color_generator\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        value: str = None,\n        *,\n        label: Optional[str] = None,\n        show_label: bool = True,\n        interactive: Optional[bool] = None,\n        visible: bool = True,\n        elem_id: Optional[str] = None,\n        **kwargs,\n    ):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parameters:\n            value: default text to provide in color picker.\n            label: component name in interface.\n            show_label: if True, will display label.\n            interactive: if True, will be rendered as an editable color picker; if False, editing will be disabled.

Again, the suggestion is to reference an existing demo. Write the code for the demo in a file called run.py, add the necessary requirements and an image showing the application interface. Finally add a gif showing its usage.\nYou can take a look at the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/tree/main/demo/color_picker\">demo</a> created for the ColorPicker, where an icon and a color selected through the new component is taken as input, and the same icon colored with the selected color is returned as output.</p>\n\n<p>To test the application:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>run on a terminal <code>python path/demo/run.py</code> which starts the backend at the address <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://localhost:7860\">http://localhost:7860</a>;</li>\n<li>in another terminal, run <code>pnpm dev</code> to start the frontend at <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://localhost:9876\">http://localhost:9876</a> with hot reload functionalities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>In this guide, we have shown how simple it is to add a new component to Gradio, seeing step by step how the ColorPicker component was added.

Recreate the behavior of Interfaces's interpretation feature in a Blocks app.\n2. Customize how interpretations are displayed in a Blocks app.\n\nLet's get started!\n\n## Setting up the Blocks app\n\nLet's build a sentiment classification app with the Blocks API.\nThis app will take text as input and output the probability that this text expresses either negative or positive sentiment.\nWe'll have a single input `Textbox` and a single output `Label` component.\nBelow is the code for the app as well as the app itself.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr \nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nsentiment_classifier = pipeline(\"text-classification\", return_all_scores=True)\n\ndef classifier(text):\n    pred = sentiment_classifier(text)\n    return {p[\"label\"]: p[\"score\"] for p in pred[0]}\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            input_text = gr.Textbox(label=\"Input Text\")\n            with gr.Row():\n                classify = gr.Button(\"Classify Sentiment\")\n        with gr.Column():\n            label = gr.Label(label=\"Predicted Sentiment\")\n\n    classify.click(classifier, input_text, label)\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n<gradio-app space=\"freddyaboulton/sentiment-classification\"> </gradio-app>\n\n## Adding interpretations to the app\n\nOur goal is to present to our users how the words in the input contribute to the model's prediction.\nThis will help our users understand how the model works and also evaluate its effectiveness.\nFor example, we should expect our model to identify the words \"happy\" and \"love\" with positive sentiment - if not it's a sign we made a mistake in training it!\n\nFor each word in the input, we will compute a score of how much the model's prediction of positive sentiment is changed by that word.\nOnce we have those `(word, score)` pairs we can use gradio to visualize them for the user.\n\nThe [shap](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library will help us compute the `(word, score)` pairs and\ngradio will take care of displaying the output to the user.\n\nThe following code computes the `(word, score)` pairs:\n\n```python\ndef interpretation_function(text):\n    explainer = shap.Explainer(sentiment_classifier)\n    shap_values = explainer([text])\n    \n    # Dimensions are (batch size, text size, number of classes)\n    # Since we care about positive sentiment, use index 1\n    scores = list(zip(shap_values.data[0], shap_values.values[0, :, 1]))\n    # Scores contains (word, score) pairs\n    \n    \n    # Format expected by gr.components.Interpretation\n    return {\"original\": text, \"interpretation\": scores}\n```\n\nNow, all we have to do is add a button that runs this function when clicked.\nTo display the interpretation, we will use `gr.components.Interpretation`.\nThis will color each word in the input either red or blue.\nRed if it contributes to positive sentiment and blue if it contributes to negative sentiment.\nThis is how `Interface` displays the interpretation output for text.\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            input_text = gr.Textbox(label=\"Input Text\")\n            with gr.Row():\n                classify = gr.Button(\"Classify Sentiment\")\n                interpret = gr.Button(\"Interpret\")\n        with gr.Column():\n            label = gr.Label(label=\"Predicted Sentiment\")\n        with gr.Column():\n            interpretation = gr.components.Interpretation(input_text)\n    classify.click(classifier, input_text, label)\n    interpret.click(interpretation_function, input_text, interpretation)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n<gradio-app space=\"freddyaboulton/sentiment-classification-interpretation\"> </gradio-app>\n\n\n## Customizing how the interpretation is displayed\n\nThe `gr.components.Interpretation` component does a good job of showing how individual words contribute to the sentiment prediction,\nbut what if we also wanted to display the score themselves along with the words?\n\nOne way to do this would be to generate a bar plot where the words are on the horizontal axis and the bar height corresponds\nto the shap score.\n\nWe can do this by modifying our `interpretation_function` to additionally return a matplotlib bar plot.\nWe will display it with the `gr.Plot` component in a separate tab.\n\nThis is how the interpretation function will look:\n```python\ndef interpretation_function(text):\n    explainer = shap.Explainer(sentiment_classifier)\n    shap_values = explainer([text])\n    # Dimensions are (batch size, text size, number of classes)\n    # Since we care about positive sentiment, use index 1\n    scores = list(zip(shap_values.data[0], shap_values.values[0, :, 1]))\n\n    scores_desc = sorted(scores, key=lambda t: t[1])[::-1]\n\n    # Filter out empty string added by shap\n    scores_desc = [t for t in scores_desc if t[0] != \"\"]\n\n    fig_m = plt.figure()\n    \n    # Select top 5 words that contribute to positive sentiment\n    plt.bar(x=[s[0] for s in scores_desc[:5]],\n            height=[s[1] for s in scores_desc[:5]])\n    plt.title(\"Top words contributing to positive sentiment\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Shap Value\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Word\")\n    return {\"original\": text, \"interpretation\": scores}, fig_m\n```\n\nAnd this is how the app code will look:\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            input_text = gr.Textbox(label=\"Input Text\")\n            with gr.Row():\n                classify = gr.Button(\"Classify Sentiment\")\n                interpret = gr.Button(\"Interpret\")\n        with gr.Column():\n            label = gr.Label(label=\"Predicted Sentiment\")\n        with gr.Column():\n            with gr.Tabs():\n                with gr.TabItem(\"Display interpretation with built-in component\"):\n                    interpretation = gr.components.Interpretation(input_text)\n                with gr.TabItem(\"Display interpretation with plot\"):\n                    interpretation_plot = gr.Plot()\n\n    classify.click(classifier, input_text, label)\n    interpret.click(interpretation_function, input_text, [interpretation, interpretation_plot])\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nYou can see the demo below!\n\n<gradio-app

interpretations to almost any machine learning model.\nThe output must be an `gr.Image` or `gr.Label` but the input can be almost anything (`gr.Number`, `gr.Slider`, `gr.Radio`, `gr.Image`).\n\nHere

remarks\n\nWe did a deep dive \ud83e\udd3f into how interpretations work and how you can add them to your Blocks app.\n\nWe also showed how the Blocks API gives you the power to control how the

We've also developed an analogous \"magic command\" that allows you to re-run cells faster if you use **Jupyter Notebooks** (or any similar environment like Colab).\n\nThis short Guide will cover both of these methods, so no matter how you write Python, you'll leave knowing how to build Gradio apps faster.\n\n## Python IDE Reload \ud83d\udd25\n\nIf you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let's name it `run.py`) might look something like this: \n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\", \n               inputs=inp, \n               outputs=out)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()    \n```\n\nThe problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and rerun your app by writing `python run.py`.\n\nInstead of doing this, you can run your code in **reload mode** by changing 1 word: `python` to `gradio`:\n\nIn the terminal, run `gradio run.py`. That's it! \n\nNow, you'll see that after you'll see something like this:\n\n```bash\nLaunching in *reload mode* on: http://127.0.0.1:7860 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n\nWatching...\n\nWARNING:  The --reload flag should not be used in production on Windows.\n```\n\nThe important part here is the line that says `Watching...` What's happening here is that Gradio will be observing the directory where `run.py` file lives, and if the file changes, it will automatically rerun the file for you. So you can focus on writing your code, and your Gradio demo will refresh automatically \ud83e\udd73\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Warning: the `gradio` command does not detect the parameters passed to the `launch()` methods because the `launch()` method is never called in reload mode. For example, setting `auth`, or `show_error` in `launch()` will not be reflected in the app.\n\nThere is one important thing to keep in mind when using the reload mode: Gradio specifically looks for a Gradio Blocks/Interface demo called `demo` in your code. If you have named your demo something else, you will need to pass in the name of your demo's FastAPI app as the 2nd parameter in your code. For Gradio demos, the FastAPI app can be accessed using the `.app` attribute. So if your `run.py` file looked like this:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as my_demo:\n    gr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\", \n               inputs=inp, \n               outputs=out)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    my_demo.launch()    \n```\n\nThen you would launch it in reload mode like this: `gradio run.py my_demo.app`. \n\n\ud83d\udd25 If your application accepts command line arguments, you can pass them in as well. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport argparse\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument(\"--name\", type=str, default=\"User\")\nargs, unknown = parser.parse_known_args()\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    gr.Markdown(f\"# Greetings {args.name}!\")\n    inp = gr.Textbox()\n    out = gr.Textbox()\n\n    inp.change(fn=lambda x: x, inputs=inp, outputs=out)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```\n\nWhich you could run like this: `gradio run.py --name Gretel`\n\nAs a small aside, this auto-reloading happens if you change your `run.py` source code or the Gradio source code. Meaning that this can be useful if you decide to [contribute to Gradio itself](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) \u2705\n\n## Jupyter Notebook Magic \ud83d\udd2e\n\nWhat about if you use Jupyter Notebooks (or Colab Notebooks, etc.) to develop code? We got something for you too!\n\nWe've developed a **magic command** that will create and run a Blocks demo for you. To use this, load the gradio extension at the top of your notebook: \n\n`%load_ext gradio`\n\nThen, in the cell that you are developing your Gradio demo, simply write the magic command **`%%blocks`** at the top, and then write the layout and components like you would normally:\n\n```py\n%%blocks \n\nimport gradio as gr\n\ngr.Markdown(\"# Greetings from Gradio!\")\ninp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\nout = gr.Textbox()\n\ninp.change(fn=lambda x: f\"Welcome, {x}!\", \n           inputs=inp, \n           outputs=out)\n```\n\nNotice that:\n\n* You do not need to put the boiler plate `with gr.Blocks() as demo:` and `demo.launch()` code \u2014 Gradio does that for you automatically!\n\n* Every time you rerun the cell, Gradio will re-launch your app on the same port and using the same underlying web server. This means you'll see your changes *much, much faster* than if you were rerunning the cell normally. \n\nHere's what it looks like in a jupyter notebook:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nrszFws/Blocks.gif)\n\n\ud83e\ude84 This works in colab notebooks too! [Here's a colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jUlX1w7JqckRHVE-nbDyMPyZ7fYD8488?authuser=1#scrollTo=zxHYjbCTTz_5) where you can see the Blocks magic in action. Try making some changes and re-running the cell with the Gradio code! \n\nThe Notebook Magic is now the author's preferred way of building Gradio demos. Regardless of how you write Python code, we hope either of these methods will give you a much better development experience using Gradio. \n\n--------\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow that you know how to develop quickly using Gradio, start building your own! \n\nIf you are looking for inspiration, try exploring demos other people have built with Gradio, [browse public Hugging Face Spaces](http://hf.space/) \ud83e\udd17\n\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"developing-faster-with-auto-reloading\">Developing Faster with Auto-Reloading</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: This Guide requires you to know about Blocks.

Using `gradio`, you can easily build a demo of your 3D image model and share it with anyone. The Gradio 3D Model component accepts 3 file types including: *.obj*, *.glb*, & *.gltf*.\n\nThis guide will show you how to build a demo for your 3D image model in a few lines of code; like the one below. Play around with 3D object by clicking around, dragging and zooming:\n\n<gradio-app space=\"dawood/Model3D\"> </gradio-app>\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart).\n\n\n## Taking a Look at the Code\n\nLet's take a look at how to create the minimal interface above. The prediction function in this case will just return the original 3D model mesh, but you can change this function to run inference on your machine learning model. We'll take a look at more complex examples below.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef load_mesh(mesh_file_name):\n    return mesh_file_name\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=load_mesh,\n    inputs=gr.Model3D(),\n    outputs=gr.Model3D(clear_color=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],  label=\"3D Model\"),\n    examples=[\n        [\"files/Bunny.obj\"],\n        [\"files/Duck.glb\"],\n        [\"files/Fox.gltf\"],\n        [\"files/face.obj\"],\n    ],\n    cache_examples=True,\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\nLet's break down the code above:\n\n`load_mesh`: This is our 'prediction' function and for simplicity, this function will take in the 3D model mesh and return it.\n\nCreating the Interface:\n\n* `fn`: the prediction function that is used when the user clicks submit. In our case this is the `load_mesh` function.\n* `inputs`: create a model3D input component. The input expects an uploaded file as a {str} filepath.\n* `outputs`: create a model3D output component. The output component also expects a file as a {str} filepath.\n  * `clear_color`: this is the background color of the 3D model canvas. Expects RGBa values.\n  * `label`: the label that appears on the top left of the component.\n* `examples`: list of 3D model files. The 3D model component can accept *.obj*, *.glb*, & *.gltf* file types.\n* `cache_examples`: saves the predicted output for the examples, to save time on inference.\n\n\n## Exploring mode complex Model3D Demos:\n\nBelow is a demo that uses the DPT model to predict the depth of an image and then uses 3D Point Cloud to create a 3D object. Take a look at the [app.py](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/dpt-depth-estimation-3d-obj/blob/main/app.py) file for a peek into the code and the model prediction function.\n<gradio-app space=\"radames/dpt-depth-estimation-3d-obj\"> </gradio-app>\n\nBelow is a demo that uses the PIFu model to convert an image of a clothed human into a 3D digitized model.

We will show two different ways to use the `HighlightedText` component -- depending on your NER model, either of these two ways may be easier to learn! \n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started). You will also need a pretrained named-entity recognition model. You can use your own, while in this tutorial, we will use one from the `transformers` library.\n\n### Approach 1: List of Entity Dictionaries\n\nMany named-entity recognition models output a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary consists of an *entity*, a \"start\" index, and an \"end\" index. This is, for example, how NER models in the `transformers` library operate:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import pipeline \nner_pipeline = pipeline(\"ner\")\nner_pipeline(\"Does Chicago have any Pakistani restaurants\")\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```bash\n[{'entity': 'I-LOC',\n  'score': 0.9988978,\n  'index': 2,\n  'word': 'Chicago',\n  'start': 5,\n  'end': 12},\n {'entity': 'I-MISC',\n  'score': 0.9958592,\n  'index': 5,\n  'word': 'Pakistani',\n  'start': 22,\n  'end': 31}]\n```\n\nIf you have such a model, it is very easy to hook it up to Gradio's `HighlightedText` component. All you need to do is pass in this **list of entities**, along with the **original text** to the model, together as dictionary, with the keys being `\"entities\"` and `\"text\"` respectively.\n\nHere is a complete example:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nimport gradio as gr\n\nner_pipeline = pipeline(\"ner\")\n\nexamples = [\n    \"Does Chicago have any stores and does Joe live here?\",\n]\n\ndef ner(text):\n    output = ner_pipeline(text)\n    return {\"text\": text, \"entities\": output}    \n\ndemo = gr.Interface(ner,\n             gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"Enter sentence here...\"), \n             gr.HighlightedText(),\n             examples=examples)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/ner_pipeline'></gradio-app>\n\n### Approach 2: List of Tuples\n\nAn alternative way to pass data into the `HighlightedText` component is a list of tuples. The first element of each tuple should be the word or words that are being classified into a particular entity. The second element should be the entity label (or `None` if they should be unlabeled). The `HighlightedText` component automatically strings together the words and labels to display the entities.\n\nIn some cases, this can be easier than the first approach. Here is a demo showing this approach using Spacy's parts-of-speech tagger:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport os\nos.system('python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm')\nimport spacy\nfrom spacy import displacy\n\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\ndef text_analysis(text):\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    html = displacy.render(doc, style=\"dep\", page=True)\n    html = (\n        \"<div style='max-width:100%; max-height:360px; overflow:auto'>\"\n        + html\n        + \"</div>\"\n    )\n    pos_count = {\n        \"char_count\": len(text),\n        \"token_count\": 0,\n    }\n    pos_tokens = []\n\n    for token in doc:\n        pos_tokens.extend([(token.text, token.pos_), (\" \", None)])\n\n    return pos_tokens, pos_count, html\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    text_analysis,\n    gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"Enter sentence here...\"),\n    [\"highlight\", \"json\", \"html\"],\n    examples=[\n        [\"What a beautiful morning for a walk!\"],\n        [\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\"],\n    ],\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/text_analysis'></gradio-app>\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnd you're done!

ASR algorithms run on practically every smartphone, and are becoming increasingly embedded in professional workflows, such as digital assistants for nurses and doctors. Because ASR algorithms are designed to be used directly by customers and end users, it is important to validate that they are behaving as expected when confronted with a wide variety of speech patterns (different accents, pitches, and background audio conditions).\n\nUsing `gradio`, you can easily build a demo of your ASR model and share that with a testing team, or test it yourself by speaking through the microphone on your device.\n\nThis tutorial will show how to take a pretrained speech-to-text model and deploy it with a Gradio interface. We will start with a ***full-context*** model, in which the user speaks the entire audio before the prediction runs. Then we will adapt the demo to make it ***streaming***, meaning that the audio model will convert speech as you speak. The streaming demo that we create will look something like this (try it below or [in a new tab](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/streaming-asr-paused)!):\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-streaming-asr-paused.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"350\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\nReal-time ASR is inherently *stateful*, meaning that the model's predictions change depending on what words the user previously spoke. So, in this tutorial, we will also cover how to use **state** with Gradio demos. \n\n### Prerequisites\n\nMake sure you have the `gradio` Python package already [installed](/getting_started). You will also need a pretrained speech recognition model. In this tutorial, we will build demos from 2 ASR libraries:\n\n* Transformers (for this, `pip install transformers` and `pip install torch`) \n* DeepSpeech (`pip install deepspeech==0.8.2`)\n\nMake sure you have at least one of these installed so that you can follow along the tutorial. You will also need `ffmpeg` [installed on your system](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html), if you do not already have it, to process files from the microphone.\n\nHere's how to build a real time speech recognition (ASR) app: \n\n1. [Set up the Transformers ASR Model](#1-set-up-the-transformers-asr-model)\n2. [Create a Full-Context ASR Demo with Transformers](#2-create-a-full-context-asr-demo-with-transformers) \n3. [Create a Streaming ASR Demo  with Transformers](#3-create-a-streaming-asr-demo-with-transformers)\n4. [Create a Streaming ASR Demo with DeepSpeech](#4-create-a-streaming-asr-demo-with-deep-speech)\n\n\n## 1. Set up the Transformers ASR Model\n\nFirst, you will need to have an ASR model that you have either trained yourself or you will need to download a pretrained model. In this tutorial, we will start by using a pretrained ASR model from the Hugging Face model, `Wav2Vec2`. \n\nHere is the code to load `Wav2Vec2` from Hugging Face `transformers`.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\np = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\")\n```\n\nThat's it! By default, the automatic speech recognition model pipeline loads Facebook's `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h` model.\n\n## 2. Create a Full-Context ASR Demo with Transformers \n\nWe will start by creating a *full-context* ASR demo, in which the user speaks the full audio before using the ASR model to run inference. This is very easy with Gradio -- we simply create a function around the `pipeline` object above.\n\nWe will use `gradio`'s built in `Audio` component, configured to take input from the user's microphone and return a filepath for the recorded audio. The output component will be a plain `Textbox`.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef transcribe(audio):\n    text = p(audio)[\"text\"]\n    return text\n\ngr.Interface(\n    fn=transcribe, \n    inputs=gr.Audio(source=\"microphone\", type=\"filepath\"), \n    outputs=\"text\").launch()\n```\n\nSo what's happening here? The `transcribe` function takes a single parameter, `audio`, which is a filepath to the audio file that the user has recorded. The `pipeline` object expects a filepath and converts it to text, which is returned to the frontend and displayed in a textbox. \n\nLet's see it in action! (Record a short audio clip and then click submit, or [open in a new tab](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/full-context-asr)):\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-full-context-asr.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"350\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n## 3. Create a Streaming ASR Demo  with Transformers\n\nOk great! We've built an ASR model that works well for short audio clips. However, if you are recording longer audio clips, you probably want a *streaming* interface, one that transcribes audio as the user speaks instead of just all-at-once at the end.\n\nThe good news is that it's not too difficult to adapt the demo we just made to make it streaming, using the same `Wav2Vec2` model. \n\nThe biggest change is that we must now introduce a `state` parameter, which holds the audio that has been *transcribed so far*. This allows us to only the latest chunk of audio and simply append it to the audio we previously transcribed. \n\nWhen adding state to a Gradio demo, you need to do a total of 3 things:\n\n* Add a `state` parameter to the function\n* Return the updated `state` at the end of the function\n* Add the `\"state\"` components to the `inputs` and `outputs` in `Interface` \n\nHere's what the code looks like:\n\n```python\ndef transcribe(audio, state=\"\"):\n    text = p(audio)[\"text\"]\n    state += text + \" \"\n    return state, state\n\n# Set the starting state to an empty string\n\ngr.Interface(\n    fn=transcribe, \n    inputs=[\n        gr.Audio(source=\"microphone\", type=\"filepath\", streaming=True), \n        \"state\" \n    ],\n    outputs=[\n        \"textbox\",\n        \"state\"\n    ],\n    live=True).launch()\n```\n\nNotice that we've also made one other change, which is that we've set `live=True`. This keeps the Gradio interface running constantly, so it automatically transcribes audio without the user having to repeatedly hit the submit button.\n\nLet's see how it does (try below or [in a new tab](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/streaming-asr))!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-streaming-asr.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"350\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n\nOne thing that you may notice is that the transcription quality has dropped since the chunks of audio are so small, they lack the context to properly be transcribed. A \"hacky\" fix to this is to simply increase the runtime of the `transcribe()` function so that longer audio chunks are processed. We can do this by adding a `time.sleep()` inside the function, as shown below (we'll see a proper fix next) \n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport gradio as gr\nimport time\n\np = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\")\n\ndef transcribe(audio, state=\"\"):\n    time.sleep(2)\n    text = p(audio)[\"text\"]\n    state += text + \" \"\n    return state, state\n\ngr.Interface(\n    fn=transcribe, \n    inputs=[\n        gr.Audio(source=\"microphone\", type=\"filepath\", streaming=True), \n        \"state\"\n    ],\n    outputs=[\n        \"textbox\",\n        \"state\"\n    ],\n    live=True).launch()\n```\n\nTry the demo below to see the difference (or [open in a new tab](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/streaming-asr-paused))!\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-streaming-asr-paused.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"350\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n\n## 4. Create a Streaming ASR Demo with DeepSpeech\n\nYou're not restricted to ASR models from the `transformers` library -- you can use your own models or models from other libraries. The `DeepSpeech` library contains models that are specifically designed to handle streaming audio data. These models perform really well with  streaming data as they are able to account for previous chunks of audio data when making predictions.\n\nGoing through the DeepSpeech library is beyond the scope of this Guide (check out their [excellent documentation here](https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/en/r0.9/)), but you can use Gradio very similarly with a DeepSpeech ASR model as with a Transformers ASR model. \n\nHere's a complete example (on Linux):\n\nFirst install the DeepSpeech library and download the pretrained models from the terminal:\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.8.2/deepspeech-0.8.2-models.pbmm\nwget https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.8.2/deepspeech-0.8.2-models.scorer\napt install libasound2-dev portaudio19-dev libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 ffmpeg\npip install deepspeech==0.8.2\n```\n\nThen, create a similar `transcribe()` function as before:\n\n```python\nfrom deepspeech import Model\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel_file_path = \"deepspeech-0.8.2-models.pbmm\"\nlm_file_path = \"deepspeech-0.8.2-models.scorer\"\nbeam_width = 100\nlm_alpha = 0.93\nlm_beta = 1.18\n\nmodel = Model(model_file_path)\nmodel.enableExternalScorer(lm_file_path)\nmodel.setScorerAlphaBeta(lm_alpha, lm_beta)\nmodel.setBeamWidth(beam_width)\n\n\ndef reformat_freq(sr, y):\n    if sr not in (\n        48000,\n        16000,\n    ):  # Deepspeech only supports 16k, (we convert 48k -> 16k)\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported rate\", sr)\n    if sr == 48000:\n        y = (\n            ((y / max(np.max(y), 1)) * 32767)\n            .reshape((-1, 3))\n            .mean(axis=1)\n            .astype(\"int16\")\n        )\n        sr = 16000\n    return sr, y\n\n\ndef transcribe(speech, stream):\n    _, y = reformat_freq(*speech)\n    if stream is None:\n        stream = model.createStream()\n    stream.feedAudioContent(y)\n    text = stream.intermediateDecode()\n    return text, stream\n\n```\n\nThen, create a Gradio Interface as before (the only difference being that the return type should be `numpy` instead of a `filepath` to be compatible with the DeepSpeech models)\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ngr.Interface(\n    fn=transcribe, \n    inputs=[\n        gr.Audio(source=\"microphone\", type=\"numpy\"), \n        \"state\" \n    ], \n    outputs= [\n        \"text\", \n        \"state\"\n    ], \n    live=True).launch()\n```\n\nRunning all of this should allow you to deploy your realtime ASR model with a nice GUI. Try it out and see how well it works for you.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnd you're done! That's all the code you need to build a web-based GUI for your ASR model. \n\nFun tip: you can share your ASR model instantly with others simply by setting `share=True` in `launch()`. \n\n\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"real-time-speech-recognition\">Real Time Speech Recognition</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR), the conversion of spoken speech to text, is a very important and thriving area of machine learning.

In this tutorial, we will start by using a pretrained ASR model from the Hugging Face model, <code>Wav2Vec2</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the code to load <code>Wav2Vec2</code> from Hugging Face <code>transformers</code>.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from transformers import pipeline\n\np = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\")\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>That's it! By default, the automatic speech recognition model pipeline loads Facebook's <code>facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h</code> model.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-create-a-full-context-asr-demo-with-transformers\">2. Create a Full-Context ASR Demo with Transformers</h2>\n\n<p>We will start by creating a <em>full-context</em> ASR demo, in which the user speaks the full audio before using the ASR model to run inference. This is very easy with Gradio -- we simply create a function around the <code>pipeline</code> object above.</p>\n\n<p>We will use <code>gradio</code>'s built in <code>Audio</code> component, configured to take input from the user's microphone and return a filepath for the recorded audio. The output component will be a plain <code>Textbox</code>.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ndef transcribe(audio):\n    text = p(audio)[\"text\"]\n    return text\n\ngr.Interface(\n    fn=transcribe, \n    inputs=gr.Audio(source=\"microphone\", type=\"filepath\"), \n    outputs=\"text\").launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>So what's happening here? The <code>transcribe</code> function takes a single parameter, <code>audio</code>, which is a filepath to the audio file that the user has recorded. The <code>pipeline</code> object expects a filepath and converts it to text, which is returned to the frontend and displayed in a textbox. </p>\n\n<p>Let's see it in action! (Record a short audio clip and then click submit, or <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/full-context-asr\">open in a new tab</a>):</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-full-context-asr.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"350\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-create-a-streaming-asr-demo-with-transformers\">3. Create a Streaming ASR Demo  with Transformers</h2>\n\n<p>Ok great! We've built an ASR model that works well for short audio clips. However, if you are recording longer audio clips, you probably want a <em>streaming</em> interface, one that transcribes audio as the user speaks instead of just all-at-once at the end.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that it's not too difficult to adapt the demo we just made to make it streaming, using the same <code>Wav2Vec2</code> model. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest change is that we must now introduce a <code>state</code> parameter, which holds the audio that has been <em>transcribed so far</em>. This allows us to only the latest chunk of audio and simply append it to the audio we previously transcribed. </p>\n\n<p>When adding state to a Gradio demo, you need to do a total of 3 things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add a <code>state</code> parameter to the function</li>\n<li>Return the updated <code>state</code> at the end of the function</li>\n<li>Add the <code>\"state\"</code> components to the <code>inputs</code> and <code>outputs</code> in <code>Interface</code> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's what the code looks like:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>def transcribe(audio, state=\"\"):\n    text = p(audio)[\"text\"]\n    state += text + \" \"\n    return state, state\n\n# Set the starting state to an empty string\n\ngr.Interface(\n    fn=transcribe, \n    inputs=[\n        gr.Audio(source=\"microphone\", type=\"filepath\", streaming=True), \n        \"state\" \n    ],\n    outputs=[\n        \"textbox\",\n        \"state\"\n    ],\n    live=True).launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Notice that we've also made one other change, which is that we've set <code>live=True</code>. This keeps the Gradio interface running constantly, so it automatically transcribes audio without the user having to repeatedly hit the submit button.</p>\n\n<p>Let's see how it does (try below or <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/streaming-asr\">in a new tab</a>)!</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-streaming-asr.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"350\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n<p>One thing that you may notice is that the transcription quality has dropped since the chunks of audio are so small, they lack the context to properly be transcribed. A \"hacky\" fix to this is to simply increase the runtime of the <code>transcribe()</code> function so that longer audio chunks are processed. We can do this by adding a <code>time.sleep()</code> inside the function, as shown below (we'll see a proper fix next) </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from transformers import pipeline\nimport gradio as gr\nimport time\n\np = pipeline(\"automatic-speech-recognition\")\n\ndef transcribe(audio, state=\"\"):\n    time.sleep(2)\n    text = p(audio)[\"text\"]\n    state += text + \" \"\n    return state, state\n\ngr.Interface(\n    fn=transcribe, \n    inputs=[\n        gr.Audio(source=\"microphone\", type=\"filepath\", streaming=True), \n        \"state\"\n    ],\n    outputs=[\n        \"textbox\",\n        \"state\"\n    ],\n    live=True).launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Try the demo below to see the difference (or <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/abidlabs/streaming-asr-paused\">open in a new tab</a>)!</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://abidlabs-streaming-asr-paused.hf.space\" frameBorder=\"0\" height=\"350\" title=\"Gradio app\" class=\"container p-0 flex-grow space-iframe\" allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; autoplay; battery; camera; document-domain; encrypted-media; fullscreen; geolocation; gyroscope; layout-animations; legacy-image-formats; magnetometer; microphone; midi; oversized-images; payment; picture-in-picture; publickey-credentials-get; sync-xhr; usb; vr ; wake-lock; xr-spatial-tracking\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-downloads\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-create-a-streaming-asr-demo-with-deepspeech\">4. Create a Streaming ASR Demo with DeepSpeech</h2>\n\n<p>You're not restricted to ASR models from the <code>transformers</code> library -- you can use your own models or models from other libraries. The <code>DeepSpeech</code> library contains models that are specifically designed to handle streaming audio data. These models perform really well with  streaming data as they are able to account for previous chunks of audio data when making predictions.</p>\n\n<p>Going through the DeepSpeech library is beyond the scope of this Guide (check out their <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/en/r0.9/\">excellent documentation here</a>), but you can use Gradio very similarly with a DeepSpeech ASR model as with a Transformers ASR model. </p>\n\n<p>Here's a complete example (on Linux):</p>\n\n<p>First install the DeepSpeech library and download the pretrained models from the terminal:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-bash'>wget https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.8.2/deepspeech-0.8.2-models.pbmm\nwget https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.8.2/deepspeech-0.8.2-models.scorer\napt install libasound2-dev portaudio19-dev libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 ffmpeg\npip install deepspeech==0.8.2\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then, create a similar <code>transcribe()</code> function as before:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from deepspeech import Model\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel_file_path = \"deepspeech-0.8.2-models.pbmm\"\nlm_file_path = \"deepspeech-0.8.2-models.scorer\"\nbeam_width = 100\nlm_alpha = 0.93\nlm_beta = 1.18\n\nmodel = Model(model_file_path)\nmodel.enableExternalScorer(lm_file_path)\nmodel.setScorerAlphaBeta(lm_alpha, lm_beta)\nmodel.setBeamWidth(beam_width)\n\n\ndef reformat_freq(sr, y):\n    if sr not in (\n        48000,\n        16000,\n    ):  # Deepspeech only supports 16k, (we convert 48k -> 16k)\n        raise ValueError(\"Unsupported rate\", sr)\n    if sr == 48000:\n        y = (\n            ((y / max(np.max(y), 1)) * 32767)\n            .reshape((-1, 3))\n            .mean(axis=1)\n            .astype(\"int16\")\n        )\n        sr = 16000\n    return sr, y\n\n\ndef transcribe(speech, stream):\n    _, y = reformat_freq(*speech)\n    if stream is None:\n        stream = model.createStream()\n    stream.feedAudioContent(y)\n    text = stream.intermediateDecode()\n    return text, stream\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then, create a Gradio Interface as before (the only difference being that the return type should be <code>numpy</code> instead of a <code>filepath</code> to be compatible with the DeepSpeech models)</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ngr.Interface(\n    fn=transcribe, \n    inputs=[\n        gr.Audio(source=\"microphone\", type=\"numpy\"), \n        \"state\" \n    ], \n    outputs= [\n        \"text\", \n        \"state\"\n    ], \n    live=True).launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Running all of this should allow you to deploy your realtime ASR model with a nice GUI.

Let's write some code that creates a database table to\nstore this data. We'll also write some functions to insert a review into that table and fetch the latest 10 reviews.\n\nWe're going to use the `sqlite3` library to connect to our sqlite database but gradio will work with any library.\n\nThe code will look like this:\n\n```python\nDB_FILE = \"./reviews.db\"\ndb = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)\n\n# Create table if it doesn't already exist\ntry:\n    db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM reviews\").fetchall()\n    db.close()\nexcept sqlite3.OperationalError:\n    db.execute(\n        '''\n        CREATE TABLE reviews (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,\n                              created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,\n                              name TEXT, review INTEGER, comments TEXT)\n        ''')\n    db.commit()\n    db.close()\n\ndef get_latest_reviews(db: sqlite3.Connection):\n    reviews = db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM reviews ORDER BY id DESC limit 10\").fetchall()\n    total_reviews = db.execute(\"Select COUNT(id) from reviews\").fetchone()[0]\n    reviews = pd.DataFrame(reviews, columns=[\"id\", \"date_created\", \"name\", \"review\", \"comments\"])\n    return reviews, total_reviews\n\n\ndef add_review(name: str, review: int, comments: str):\n    db = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)\n    cursor = db.cursor()\n    cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO reviews(name, review, comments) VALUES(?,?,?)\", [name, review, comments])\n    db.commit()\n    reviews, total_reviews = get_latest_reviews(db)\n    db.close()\n    return reviews, total_reviews\n```\n\nLet's also write a function to load the latest reviews when the gradio application loads:\n```python\ndef load_data():\n    db = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)\n    reviews, total_reviews = get_latest_reviews(db)\n    db.close()\n    return reviews, total_reviews\n```\n\n## Step 2 - Create a gradio app \u26a1\nNow that we have our database logic defined, we can use gradio create a dynamic web page to ask our users for feedback! \n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            name = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\", placeholder=\"What is your name?\")\n            review = gr.Radio(label=\"How satisfied are you with using gradio?\", choices=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n            comments = gr.Textbox(label=\"Comments\", lines=10, placeholder=\"Do you have any feedback on gradio?\")\n            submit = gr.Button(value=\"Submit Feedback\")\n        with gr.Column():\n            data = gr.Dataframe(label=\"Most recently created 10 rows\")\n            count = gr.Number(label=\"Total number of reviews\")\n    submit.click(add_review, [name, review, comments], [data, count])\n    demo.load(load_data, None, [data, count])\n```\n\n## Step 3 - Synchronize with HuggingFace Datasets \ud83e\udd17\n\nWe could call `demo.launch()` after step 2 and have a fully functioning application. However,\nour data would be stored locally on our machine. If the sqlite file were accidentally deleted, we'd lose all of our reviews!\nLet's back up our data to a dataset on the HuggingFace hub.\n\nCreate a dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets) before proceeding.\n\nNow at the **top** of our script, we'll use the [huggingface hub client library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/index)\nto connect to our dataset and pull the latest backup.\n\n```python\nTOKEN = os.environ.get('HUB_TOKEN')\nrepo = huggingface_hub.Repository(\n    local_dir=\"data\",\n    repo_type=\"dataset\",\n    clone_from=\"<name-of-your-dataset>\",\n    use_auth_token=TOKEN\n)\nrepo.git_pull()\n\nshutil.copyfile(\"./data/reviews.db\", DB_FILE)\n```\n\nNote that you'll have to get an access token from the \"Settings\" tab of your HuggingFace for the above code to work.\nIn the script, the token is securely accessed via an environment variable.\n\n![access_token](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/access_token.png?raw=true)\n\nNow we will create a background task to synch our local database to the dataset hub every 60 seconds.\nWe will use the [AdvancedPythonScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/) to handle the scheduling.\nHowever, this is not the only task scheduling library available. Feel free to use whatever you are comfortable with.\n\nThe function to back up our data will look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler\n\ndef backup_db():\n    shutil.copyfile(DB_FILE, \"./data/reviews.db\")\n    db = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)\n    reviews = db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM reviews\").fetchall()\n    pd.DataFrame(reviews).to_csv(\"./data/reviews.csv\", index=False)\n    print(\"updating db\")\n    repo.push_to_hub(blocking=False, commit_message=f\"Updating data at {datetime.datetime.now()}\")\n\n\nscheduler = BackgroundScheduler()\nscheduler.add_job(func=backup_db, trigger=\"interval\", seconds=60)\nscheduler.start()\n```\n\n\n## Step 4 (Bonus) - Deployment to HuggingFace Spaces\nYou can use the HuggingFace [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) platform to deploy this application for free \u2728\n\nIf you haven't used Spaces before, follow the previous guide [here](/using_hugging_face_integrations).\nYou will have to use the `HUB_TOKEN` environment variable as a secret in the Guides.\n\n## Conclusion\nCongratulations!

Gradio apps can be deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.space) for free. \n\nIn some cases though, you might want to deploy a Gradio app on your own web server. You might already be using [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), a highly performant web server, to serve your website (say `https://www.example.com`), and you want to attach Gradio to a specific subpath on your website (e.g. `https://www.example.com/gradio-demo`). \n\nIn this Guide, we will guide you through the process of running a Gradio app behind Nginx on your own web server to achieve this.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n1. A Linux web server with [Nginx installed](https://www.nginx.com/blog/setting-up-nginx/) and [Gradio installed](/quickstart)  \n    \n2. A working Gradio app saved as a python file on your web server\n\n## Editing your Nginx configuration file\n\n1. Start by editing the Nginx configuration file on your web server. By default, this is located at: `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`\n\nIn the `http` block, add the following line to include server block configurations from a separate file:\n\n```bash\ninclude /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;\n```\n\n2. Create a new file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory (create the directory if it does not already exist), using a filename that represents your app, for example: `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/my_gradio_app`\n\n3. Paste the following into your file editor:\n\n```bash\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name example.com www.example.com;  # Change this to your domain name \n\n    location /gradio-demo/ {  # Change this if you'd like to server your Gradio app on a different path\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:7860/; # Change this if your Gradio app will be running on a different port\n        proxy_redirect off;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Run your Gradio app on your web server\n\n1. Before you launch your Gradio app, you'll need to set the `root_path` to be the same as the subpath that you specified in your nginx configuration. This is necessary for Gradio to run on any subpath besides the root of the domain.\n\nHere's a simple example of a Gradio app with a custom `root_path`:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport time\n\ndef test(x):\ntime.sleep(4)\nreturn x\n\ngr.Interface(test, \"textbox\", \"textbox\").queue().launch(root_path=\"/gradio-demo\")\n```\n\n2. Start a `tmux` session by typing `tmux` and pressing enter (optional) \n\nIt's recommended that you run your Gradio app in a `tmux` session so that you can keep it running in the background easily\n\n3. Then, start your Gradio app. Simply type in `python` followed by the name of your Gradio python file. By default, your app will run on `localhost:7860`, but if it starts on a different port, you will need to update the nginx configuration file above.\n\n## Restart Nginx\n\n1. If you are in a tmux session, exit by typing CTRL+B (or CMD+B), followed by the \"D\" key.\n\n2. Finally, restart nginx by running `sudo systemctl restart nginx`. \n\nAnd that's it! If you visit `https://example.com/gradio-demo` on your browser, you should see your Gradio app running there\n\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"running-a-gradio-app-on-your-web-server-with-nginx\">Running a Gradio App on your Web Server with Nginx</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Gradio is a Python library that allows you to quickly create customizable web apps for your machine learning models and data processing pipelines.

In this Guide, we dive into some of the parameters of Gradio's `.queue()` method as well as some other related configurations, and discuss how to set these parameters in a way that allows you to serve lots of users simultaneously with minimal latency.\n\nThis is an advanced guide, so make sure you know the basics of Gradio already, such as [how to create and launch a Gradio Interface](https://gradio.app/guides/quickstart/). Most of the information in this Guide is relevant whether you are hosting your demo on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.space) or on your own server.\n\n## Enabling Gradio's Queueing System\n\nBy default, a Gradio demo does not use queueing and instead sends prediction requests via a POST request to the server where your Gradio server and Python code are running. However, regular POST requests have two big limitations:\n\n(1) They time out -- most browsers raise a timeout error\nif they do not get a response to a POST request after a short period of time (e.g. 1 min).\nThis can be a problem if your inference function takes longer than 1 minute to run or\nif many people are trying out your demo at the same time, resulting in increased latency.\n\n(2) They do not allow bi-directional communication between the Gradio demo and the Gradio server. This means, for example, that you cannot get a real-time ETA of how long your prediction will take to complete.\n\nTo address these limitations, any Gradio app can be converted to use **websockets** instead, simply by adding `.queue()` before launching an Interface or a Blocks. Here's an example:\n\n```py\napp = gr.Interface(lambda x:x, \"image\", \"image\")\napp.queue()  # <-- Sets up a queue with default parameters\napp.launch()\n```\n\nIn the demo `app` above, predictions will now be sent over a websocket instead.\nUnlike POST requests, websockets do not timeout and they allow bidirectional traffic. On the Gradio server, a **queue** is set up, which adds each request that comes to a list. When a worker is free, the first available request is passed into the worker for inference. When the inference is complete, the queue sends the prediction back through the websocket to the particular Gradio user who called that prediction. \n\nNote: If you host your Gradio app on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://hf.space), the queue is already **enabled by default**. You can still call the `.queue()` method manually in order to configure the queue parameters described below.\n\n## Queuing Parameters\n\nThere are several parameters that can be used to configure the queue and help reduce latency. Let's go through them one-by-one.\n\n### The `concurrency_count` parameter\n\nThe first parameter we will explore is the `concurrency_count` parameter of `queue()`. This parameter is used to set the number of worker threads in the Gradio server that will be processing your requests in parallel. By default, this parameter is set to `1` but increasing this can **linearly multiply the capacity of your server to handle requests**.\n\nSo why not set this parameter much higher? Keep in mind that since requests are processed in parallel, each request will consume memory to store the data and weights for processing. This means that you might get out-of-memory errors if you increase the `concurrency_count` too high. You may also start to get diminishing returns if the `concurrency_count` is too high because of costs of switching between different worker threads.\n\n**Recommendation**: Increase the `concurrency_count` parameter as high as you can while you continue to see performance gains or until you hit memory limits on your machine. You can [read about Hugging Face Spaces machine specs here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview). \n\n*Note*: there is a second parameter which controls the *total* number of threads that Gradio can generate, whether or not queuing is enabled. This is the `max_threads` parameter in the `launch()` method. When you increase the `concurrency_count` parameter in `queue()`, this is automatically increased as well. However, in some cases, you may want to manually increase this, e.g. if queuing is not enabled. \n\n### The `max_size` parameter\n\nA more blunt way to reduce the wait times is simply to prevent too many people from joining the queue in the first place. You can set the maximum number of requests that the queue processes using the `max_size` parameter of `queue()`. If a request arrives when the queue is already of the maximum size, it will not be allowed to join the queue and instead, the user will receive an error saying that the queue is full and to try again. By default, `max_size=None`, meaning that there is no limit to the number of users that can join the queue.\n\nParadoxically, setting a `max_size` can often improve user experience because it prevents users from being dissuaded by very long queue wait times. Users who are more interested and invested in your demo will keep trying to join the queue, and will be able to get their results faster. \n\n**Recommendation**: For a better user experience, set a `max_size` that is reasonable given your expectations of how long users might be willing to wait for a prediction. \n\n### The `max_batch_size` parameter\n\nAnother way to increase the parallelism of your Gradio demo is to write your function so that it can accept **batches** of inputs. Most deep learning models can process batches of samples more efficiently than processing individual samples. \n\nIf you write your function to process a batch of samples, Gradio will automatically batch incoming requests together and pass them into your function as a batch of samples. You need to set `batch` to `True` (by default it is `False`) and set a `max_batch_size` (by default it is `4`) based on the maximum number of samples your function is able to handle. These two parameters can be passed into `gr.Interface()` or to an event in Blocks such as `.click()`. \n\nWhile setting a batch is conceptually similar to having workers process requests in parallel, it is often *faster* than setting the `concurrency_count` for deep learning models. The downside is that you might need to adapt your function a little bit to accept batches of samples instead of individual samples. \n\nHere's an example of a function that does *not* accept a batch of inputs -- it processes a single input at a time:\n\n```py\nimport time\n\ndef trim_words(word, length):\n    return w[:int(length)]\n\n```\n\nHere's the same function rewritten to take in a batch of samples:\n\n```py\nimport time\n\ndef trim_words(words, lengths):\n    trimmed_words = []\n    for w, l in zip(words, lengths):\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])        \n    return [trimmed_words]\n\n```\n\nThe second function can be used with `batch=True` and an appropriate `max_batch_size` parameter.\n\n**Recommendation**: If possible, write your function to accept batches of samples, and then set `batch` to `True` and the `max_batch_size` as high as possible based on your machine's memory limits. If you set `max_batch_size` as high as possible, you will most likely need to set `concurrency_count` back to `1` since you will no longer have the memory to have multiple workers running in parallel. \n\n### The `api_open` parameter\n\nWhen creating a Gradio demo, you may want to restrict all traffic to happen through the user interface as opposed to the [programmatic API](/guides/sharing-your-app/#api-page) that is automatically created for your Gradio demo. This is important because when people make requests through the programmatic API, they can potentially bypass users who are waiting in the queue and degrade the experience of these users. \n\n**Recommendation**: set the `api_open` parameter in `queue()` to `False` in your demo to prevent programmatic requests.\n\n\n\n### Upgrading your Hardware (GPUs, TPUs, etc.)\n\nIf you have done everything above, and your demo is still not fast enough, you can upgrade the hardware that your model is running on. Changing the model from running on CPUs to running on GPUs will usually provide a 10x-50x increase in inference time for deep learning models.\n\nIt is particularly straightforward to upgrade your Hardware on Hugging Face Spaces. Simply click on the \"Settings\" tab in your Space and choose the Space Hardware you'd like.\n\n![](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/hub/spaces-gpu-settings.png)\n\nWhile you might need to adapt portions of your machine learning inference code to run on a GPU (here's a [handy guide](https://cnvrg.io/pytorch-cuda/) if you are using PyTorch), Gradio is completely agnostic to the choice of hardware and will work completely fine if you use it with CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware!\n\nNote: your GPU memory is different than your CPU memory, so if you upgrade your hardware,\nyou might need to adjust the value of the `concurrency_count` parameter described above.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations!

The downside is that you might need to adapt your function a little bit to accept batches of samples instead of individual samples. </p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of a function that does <em>not</em> accept a batch of inputs -- it processes a single input at a time:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>import time\n\ndef trim_words(word, length):\n    return w[:int(length)]\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Here's the same function rewritten to take in a batch of samples:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-py'>import time\n\ndef trim_words(words, lengths):\n    trimmed_words = []\n    for w, l in zip(words, lengths):\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])        \n    return [trimmed_words]\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The second function can be used with <code>batch=True</code> and an appropriate <code>max_batch_size</code> parameter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: If possible, write your function to accept batches of samples, and then set <code>batch</code> to <code>True</code> and the <code>max_batch_size</code> as high as possible based on your machine's memory limits. If you set <code>max_batch_size</code> as high as possible, you will most likely need to set <code>concurrency_count</code> back to <code>1</code> since you will no longer have the memory to have multiple workers running in parallel. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-api_open-parameter\">The <code>api_open</code> parameter</h3>\n\n<p>When creating a Gradio demo, you may want to restrict all traffic to happen through the user interface as opposed to the <a rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"/guides/sharing-your-app/#api-page\">programmatic API</a> that is automatically created for your Gradio demo.

To do so, pass the `theme=` kwarg to the `Blocks` or `Interface` constructor. For example:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Soft()) as demo:\n    ...\n```\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-theme-soft.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\nGradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from `gr.themes.*`. These are:\n\n* `gr.themes.Base()`\n* `gr.themes.Default()`\n* `gr.themes.Glass()`\n* `gr.themes.Monochrome()`\n* `gr.themes.Soft()`\n\nEach of these themes set values for hundreds of CSS variables. You can use prebuilt themes as a starting point for your own custom themes, or you can create your own themes from scratch. Let's take a look at each approach.\n\n## Using the Theme Builder\n\nThe easiest way to build a theme is using the Theme Builder. To launch the Theme Builder locally, run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ngr.themes.builder()\n```\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/theme_builder'></gradio-app>\n\nYou can use the Theme Builder running on Spaces above, though it runs much faster when you launch it locally via `gr.themes.builder()`. \n\nAs you edit the values in the Theme Builder, the app will preview updates in real time. You can download the code to generate the theme you've created so you can use it in any Gradio app.\n\nIn the rest of the guide, we will cover building themes programmatically.\n\n## Extending Themes via the Constructor\n\nAlthough each theme has hundreds of CSS variables, the values for most these variables are drawn from 8 core variables which can be set through the constructor of each prebuilt theme. Modifying these 8 arguments allows you to quickly change the look and feel of your app.\n\n### Core Colors\n\nThe first 3 constructor arguments set the colors of the theme and are `gradio.themes.Color` objects. Internally, these Color objects hold brightness values for the palette of a single hue, ranging from 50, 100, 200..., 800, 900, 950. Other CSS variables are derived from these 3 colors.\n\nThe 3 color constructor arguments are:\n\n- `primary_hue`: This is the color draws attention in your theme. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.colors.orange`.\n- `secondary_hue`: This is the color that is used for secondary elements in your theme. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.colors.blue`.\n- `neutral_hue`: This is the color that is used for text and other neutral elements in your theme. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.colors.gray`.\n\nYou could modify these values using their string shortcuts, such as\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(primary_hue=\"red\", secondary_hue=\"pink\")) as demo:\n    ...\n```\n\nor you could use the `Color` objects directly, like this:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(primary_hue=gr.themes.colors.red, secondary_hue=gr.themes.colors.pink)) as demo:\n    ...\n```\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-theme-extended-step-1.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\nPredefined colors are:\n\n* `slate`\n* `gray`\n* `zinc`\n* `neutral`\n* `stone`\n* `red`\n* `orange`\n* `amber`\n* `yellow`\n* `lime`\n* `green`\n* `emerald`\n* `teal`\n* `cyan`\n* `sky`\n* `blue`\n* `indigo`\n* `violet`\n* `purple`\n* `fuchsia`\n* `pink`\n* `rose`\n\nYou could also create your own custom `Color` objects and pass them in.\n\n### Core Sizing\n\nThe next 3 constructor arguments set the sizing of the theme and are `gradio.themes.Size` objects. Internally, these Size objects hold pixel size values that range from `xxs` to `xxl`. Other CSS variables are derived from these 3 sizes.\n\n- `spacing_size`: This sets the padding within and spacing between elements. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.sizes.spacing_md`.\n- `radius_size`: This sets the roundedness of corners of elements. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.sizes.radius_md`.\n- `text_size`: This sets the font size of text. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.sizes.text_md`.\n\nYou could modify these values using their string shortcuts, such as\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(spacing_size=\"sm\", radius_size=\"none\")) as demo:\n    ...\n```\n\nor you could use the `Size` objects directly, like this:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(spacing_size=gr.themes.sizes.spacing_sm, radius_size=gr.themes.sizes.radius_none)) as demo:\n    ...\n```\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-theme-extended-step-2.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\nThe predefined size objects are:\n\n* `radius_none`\n* `radius_sm`\n* `radius_md`\n* `radius_lg`\n* `spacing_sm`\n* `spacing_md`\n* `spacing_lg`\n* `text_sm`\n* `text_md`\n* `text_lg`\n\nYou could also create your own custom `Size` objects and pass them in.\n\n### Core Fonts\n\nThe final 2 constructor arguments set the fonts of the theme. You can pass a list of fonts to each of these arguments to specify fallbacks. If you provide a string, it will be loaded as a system font. If you provide a `gradio.themes.GoogleFont`, the font will be loaded from Google Fonts.\n\n- `font`: This sets the primary font of the theme. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.GoogleFont(\"Source Sans Pro\")`.\n- `font_mono`: This sets the monospace font of the theme. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.GoogleFont(\"IBM Plex Mono\")`.\n\nYou could modify these values such as the following:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(font=[gr.themes.GoogleFont(\"Inconsolata\"), \"Arial\", \"sans-serif\"])) as demo:\n    ...\n```\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-theme-extended-step-3.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n## Extending Themes via `.set()`\n\nYou can also modify the values of CSS variables after the theme has been loaded. To do so, use the `.set()` method of the theme object to get access to the CSS variables. For example:\n\n```python\ntheme = gr.themes.Default(primary_hue=\"blue\").set(\n    loader_color=\"#FF0000\",\n    slider_color=\"#FF0000\",\n)\n\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=theme) as demo:\n    ...\n```\n\nIn the example above, we've set the `loader_color` and `slider_color` variables to `#FF0000`, despite the overall `primary_color` using the blue color palette. You can set any CSS variable that is defined in the theme in this manner. \n\nYour IDE type hinting should help you navigate these variables. Since there are so many CSS variables, let's take a look at how these variables are named and organized.\n\n### CSS Variable Naming Conventions\n\nCSS variable names can get quite long, like `button_primary_background_fill_hover_dark`! However they follow a common naming convention that makes it easy to understand what they do and to find the variable you're looking for. Separated by underscores, the variable name is made up of:\n\n1. The target element, such as `button`, `slider`, or `block`.\n2. The target element type or sub-element, such as `button_primary`, or `block_label`.\n3. The property, such as `button_primary_background_fill`, or `block_label_border_width`.\n4. Any relevant state, such as `button_primary_background_fill_hover`.\n5. If the value is different in dark mode, the suffix `_dark`. For example, `input_border_color_focus_dark`.\n\nOf course, many CSS variable names are shorter than this, such as `table_border_color`, or `input_shadow`. \n\n### CSS Variable Organization\n\nThough there are hundreds of CSS variables, they do not all have to have individual values. They draw their values by referencing a set of core variables and referencing each other. This allows us to only have to modify a few variables to change the look and feel of the entire theme, while also getting finer control of individual elements that we may want to modify.\n\n#### Referencing Core Variables\n\nTo reference one of the core constructor variables, precede the variable name with an asterisk. To reference a core color, use the `*primary_`, `*secondary_`, or `*neutral_` prefix, followed by the brightness value. For example:\n\n```python\ntheme = gr.themes.Default(primary_hue=\"blue\").set(\n    button_primary_background_fill=\"*primary_200\",\n    button_primary_background_fill_hover=\"*primary_300\",\n)\n```\n\nIn the example above, we've set the `button_primary_background_fill` and `button_primary_background_fill_hover` variables to `*primary_200` and `*primary_300`. These variables will be set to the 200 and 300 brightness values of the blue primary color palette, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, to reference a core size, use the `*spacing_`, `*radius_`, or `*text_` prefix, followed by the size value. For example:\n\n```python\ntheme = gr.themes.Default(radius_size=\"md\").set(\n    button_primary_border_radius=\"*radius_xl\",\n)\n```\n\nIn the example above, we've set the `button_primary_border_radius` variable to `*radius_xl`. This variable will be set to the `xl` setting of the medium radius size range.\n\n#### Referencing Other Variables\n\nVariables can also reference each other. For example, look at the example below:\n\n```python\ntheme = gr.themes.Default().set(\n    button_primary_background_fill=\"#FF0000\",\n    button_primary_background_fill_hover=\"#FF0000\",\n    button_primary_border=\"#FF0000\",\n)\n```\n\nHaving to set these values to a common color is a bit tedious. Instead, we can reference the `button_primary_background_fill` variable in the `button_primary_background_fill_hover` and `button_primary_border` variables, using a `*` prefix. \n\n```python\ntheme = gr.themes.Default().set(\n    button_primary_background_fill=\"#FF0000\",\n    button_primary_background_fill_hover=\"*button_primary_background_fill\",\n    button_primary_border=\"*button_primary_background_fill\",\n)\n```\n\nNow, if we change the `button_primary_background_fill` variable, the `button_primary_background_fill_hover` and `button_primary_border` variables will automatically update as well.\n\nThis is particularly useful if you intend to share your theme - it makes it easy to modify the theme without having to change every variable.\n\nNote that dark mode variables automatically reference each other. For example:\n\n```python\ntheme = gr.themes.Default().set(\n    button_primary_background_fill=\"#FF0000\",\n    button_primary_background_fill_dark=\"#AAAAAA\",\n    button_primary_border=\"*button_primary_background_fill\",\n    button_primary_border_dark=\"*button_primary_background_fill_dark\",\n)\n```\n\n`button_primary_border_dark` will draw its value from `button_primary_background_fill_dark`, because dark mode always draw from the dark version of the variable.\n\n## Creating a Full Theme\n\nLet's say you want to create a theme from scratch! We'll go through it step by step - you can also see the source of prebuilt themes in the gradio source repo for reference - [here's the source](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/themes/monochrome.py) for the Monochrome theme.\n\nOur new theme class will inherit from `gradio.themes.Base`, a theme that sets a lot of convenient defaults. Let's make a simple demo that creates a dummy theme called Seafoam, and make a simple app that uses it.\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom gradio.themes.base import Base\nimport time\n\nclass Seafoam(Base):\n    pass\n\nseafoam = Seafoam()\n\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=seafoam) as demo:\n    textbox = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    slider = gr.Slider(label=\"Count\", minimum=0, maximum=100, step=1)\n    with gr.Row():\n        button = gr.Button(\"Submit\", variant=\"primary\")\n        clear = gr.Button(\"Clear\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\n\n    def repeat(name, count):\n        time.sleep(3)\n        return name * count\n    \n    button.click(repeat, [textbox, slider], output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-theme-new-step-1.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\nThe Base theme is very barebones, and uses `gr.themes.Blue` as it primary color - you'll note the primary button and the loading animation are both blue as a result. Let's change the defaults core arguments of our app. We'll overwrite the constructor and pass new defaults for the core constructor arguments.\n\nWe'll use `gr.themes.Emerald` as our primary color, and set secondary and neutral hues to `gr.themes.Blue`. We'll make our text larger using `text_lg`. We'll use `Quicksand` as our default font, loaded from Google Fonts. \n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nfrom typing import Iterable\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom gradio.themes.base import Base\nfrom gradio.themes.utils import colors, fonts, sizes\nimport time\n\n\nclass Seafoam(Base):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        *,\n        primary_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.emerald,\n        secondary_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.blue,\n        neutral_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.gray,\n        spacing_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.spacing_md,\n        radius_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.radius_md,\n        text_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.text_lg,\n        font: fonts.Font\n        | str\n        | Iterable[fonts.Font | str] = (\n            fonts.GoogleFont(\"Quicksand\"),\n            \"ui-sans-serif\",\n            \"sans-serif\",\n        ),\n        font_mono: fonts.Font\n        | str\n        | Iterable[fonts.Font | str] = (\n            fonts.GoogleFont(\"IBM Plex Mono\"),\n            \"ui-monospace\",\n            \"monospace\",\n        ),\n    ):\n        super().__init__(\n            primary_hue=primary_hue,\n            secondary_hue=secondary_hue,\n            neutral_hue=neutral_hue,\n            spacing_size=spacing_size,\n            radius_size=radius_size,\n            text_size=text_size,\n            font=font,\n            font_mono=font_mono,\n        )\n\n\nseafoam = Seafoam()\n\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=seafoam) as demo:\n    textbox = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    slider = gr.Slider(label=\"Count\", minimum=0, maximum=100, step=1)\n    with gr.Row():\n        button = gr.Button(\"Submit\", variant=\"primary\")\n        clear = gr.Button(\"Clear\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\n\n    def repeat(name, count):\n        time.sleep(3)\n        return name * count\n\n    button.click(repeat, [textbox, slider], output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-theme-new-step-2.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\nSee how the primary button and the loading animation are now green? These CSS variables are tied to the `primary_hue` variable. \n\nLet's modify the theme a bit more directly. We'll call the `set()` method to overwrite CSS variable values explicitly. We can use any CSS logic, and reference our core constructor arguments using the `*` prefix.\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nfrom typing import Iterable\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom gradio.themes.base import Base\nfrom gradio.themes.utils import colors, fonts, sizes\nimport time\n\n\nclass Seafoam(Base):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        *,\n        primary_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.emerald,\n        secondary_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.blue,\n        neutral_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.blue,\n        spacing_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.spacing_md,\n        radius_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.radius_md,\n        text_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.text_lg,\n        font: fonts.Font\n        | str\n        | Iterable[fonts.Font | str] = (\n            fonts.GoogleFont(\"Quicksand\"),\n            \"ui-sans-serif\",\n            \"sans-serif\",\n        ),\n        font_mono: fonts.Font\n        | str\n        | Iterable[fonts.Font | str] = (\n            fonts.GoogleFont(\"IBM Plex Mono\"),\n            \"ui-monospace\",\n            \"monospace\",\n        ),\n    ):\n        super().__init__(\n            primary_hue=primary_hue,\n            secondary_hue=secondary_hue,\n            neutral_hue=neutral_hue,\n            spacing_size=spacing_size,\n            radius_size=radius_size,\n            text_size=text_size,\n            font=font,\n            font_mono=font_mono,\n        )\n        super().set(\n            body_background_fill=\"repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, *primary_200, *primary_200 10px, *primary_50 10px, *primary_50 20px)\",\n            body_background_fill_dark=\"repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, *primary_800, *primary_800 10px, *primary_900 10px, *primary_900 20px)\",\n            button_primary_background_fill=\"linear-gradient(90deg, *primary_300, *secondary_400)\",\n            button_primary_background_fill_hover=\"linear-gradient(90deg, *primary_200, *secondary_300)\",\n            button_primary_text_color=\"white\",\n            button_primary_background_fill_dark=\"linear-gradient(90deg, *primary_600, *secondary_800)\",\n            slider_color=\"*secondary_300\",\n            slider_color_dark=\"*secondary_600\",\n            block_title_text_weight=\"600\",\n            block_border_width=\"3px\",\n            block_shadow=\"*shadow_drop_lg\",\n            button_shadow=\"*shadow_drop_lg\",\n            button_large_padding=\"32px\",\n        )\n\n\nseafoam = Seafoam()\n\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=seafoam) as demo:\n    textbox = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    slider = gr.Slider(label=\"Count\", minimum=0, maximum=100, step=1)\n    with gr.Row():\n        button = gr.Button(\"Submit\", variant=\"primary\")\n        clear = gr.Button(\"Clear\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\n\n    def repeat(name, count):\n        time.sleep(3)\n        return name * count\n\n    button.click(repeat, [textbox, slider], output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-theme-new-step-3.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\nLook how fun our theme looks now! With just a few variable changes, our theme looks completely different.\n\nYou may find it helpful to explore the [source code of the other prebuilt themes](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/themes) to see how they modified the base theme. You can also find your browser's Inspector useful to select elements from the UI and see what CSS variables are being used in the styles panel. \n\n## Sharing Themes\n\nOnce you have created a theme, you can upload it to the HuggingFace Hub to let others view it, use it, and build off of it!\n\n### Uploading a Theme\nThere are two ways to upload a theme, via the theme class instance or the command line. We will cover both of them with the previously created `seafoam` theme.\n\n* Via the class instance\n\nEach theme instance has a method called `push_to_hub` we can use to upload a theme to the HuggingFace hub.\n\n```python\nseafoam.push_to_hub(repo_name=\"seafoam\",\n                    version=\"0.0.1\",\n\t\t\t\t\thf_token=\"<token>\")\n```\n\n* Via the command line\n\nFirst save the theme to disk\n```python\nseafoam.dump(filename=\"seafoam.json\")\n```\n\nThen use the `upload_theme` command:\n\n```bash\nupload_theme\\\n\"seafoam.json\"\\\n\"seafoam\"\\\n--version \"0.0.1\"\\\n--hf_token \"<token>\"\n```\n\nIn order to upload a theme, you must have a HuggingFace account and pass your [Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/quick-start#login)\nas the `hf_token` argument. However, if you log in via the [HuggingFace command line](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/quick-start#login) (which comes installed with `gradio`),\nyou can omit the `hf_token` argument.\n\nThe `version` argument lets you specify a valid [semantic version](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/) string for your theme.\nThat way your users are able to specify which version of your theme they want to use in their apps. This also lets you publish updates to your theme without worrying\nabout changing how previously created apps look. The `version` argument is optional. If omitted, the next patch version is automatically applied.\n\n### Theme Previews\n\nBy calling `push_to_hub` or `upload_theme`, the theme assets will be stored in a [HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview).\n\nThe theme preview for our seafoam theme is here: [seafoam preview](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/seafoam).\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-seafoam.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n### Discovering Themes\n\nThe [Theme Gallery](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/theme-gallery) shows all the public gradio themes. After publishing your theme,\nit will automatically show up in the theme gallery after a couple of minutes. \n\nYou can sort the themes by the number of likes on the space and from most to least recently created as well as toggling themes between light and dark mode.\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n\tsrc=\"https://gradio-theme-gallery.hf.space\"\n\tframeborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n### Downloading\nTo use a theme from the hub, use the `from_hub` method on the `ThemeClass` and pass it to your app:\n\n```python\nmy_theme = gr.Theme.from_hub(\"gradio/seafoam\")\n\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=my_theme) as demo:\n    ....\n```\n\nYou can also pass the theme string directly to `Blocks` or `Interface` (`gr.Blocks(theme=\"gradio/seafoam\")`)\n\nYou can pin your app to an upstream theme version by using semantic versioning expressions.\n\nFor example, the following would ensure the theme we load from the `seafoam` repo was between versions `0.0.1` and `0.1.0`:\n\n```python\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=\"gradio/seafoam@>=0.0.1,<0.1.0\") as demo:\n    ....\n```\n\nEnjoy creating your own themes! If you make one you're proud of, please share it with the world by uploading it to the hub! \nIf you tag us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gradio) we can give your theme a shout out! \n\n<style>\n.wrapper {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 56.25%;\n    padding-top: 25px;\n    height: 0;\n}\n.wrapper iframe {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n</style>\n", "html": "<h1 id=\"theming\">Theming</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Gradio features a built-in theming engine that lets you customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the <code>theme=</code> kwarg to the <code>Blocks</code> or <code>Interface</code> constructor. For example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Soft()) as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n    src=\"https://gradio-theme-soft.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>Gradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from <code>gr.themes.*</code>. These are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>gr.themes.Base()</code></li>\n<li><code>gr.themes.Default()</code></li>\n<li><code>gr.themes.Glass()</code></li>\n<li><code>gr.themes.Monochrome()</code></li>\n<li><code>gr.themes.Soft()</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each of these themes set values for hundreds of CSS variables. You can use prebuilt themes as a starting point for your own custom themes, or you can create your own themes from scratch. Let's take a look at each approach.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"using-the-theme-builder\">Using the Theme Builder</h2>\n\n<p>The easiest way to build a theme is using the Theme Builder. To launch the Theme Builder locally, run the following code:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\n\ngr.themes.builder()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<gradio-app space='gradio/theme_builder'></gradio-app>\n\nYou can use the Theme Builder running on Spaces above, though it runs much faster when you launch it locally via `gr.themes.builder()`. \n\nAs you edit the values in the Theme Builder, the app will preview updates in real time. You can download the code to generate the theme you've created so you can use it in any Gradio app.\n\nIn the rest of the guide, we will cover building themes programmatically.\n\n## Extending Themes via the Constructor\n\nAlthough each theme has hundreds of CSS variables, the values for most these variables are drawn from 8 core variables which can be set through the constructor of each prebuilt theme. Modifying these 8 arguments allows you to quickly change the look and feel of your app.\n\n### Core Colors\n\nThe first 3 constructor arguments set the colors of the theme and are `gradio.themes.Color` objects. Internally, these Color objects hold brightness values for the palette of a single hue, ranging from 50, 100, 200..., 800, 900, 950. Other CSS variables are derived from these 3 colors.\n\nThe 3 color constructor arguments are:\n\n- `primary_hue`: This is the color draws attention in your theme. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.colors.orange`.\n- `secondary_hue`: This is the color that is used for secondary elements in your theme. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.colors.blue`.\n- `neutral_hue`: This is the color that is used for text and other neutral elements in your theme. In the default theme, this is set to `gradio.themes.colors.gray`.\n\nYou could modify these values using their string shortcuts, such as\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(primary_hue=\"red\", secondary_hue=\"pink\")) as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\nor you could use the `Color` objects directly, like this:\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(primary_hue=gr.themes.colors.red, secondary_hue=gr.themes.colors.pink)) as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n    src=\"https://gradio-theme-extended-step-1.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>Predefined colors are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>slate</code></li>\n<li><code>gray</code></li>\n<li><code>zinc</code></li>\n<li><code>neutral</code></li>\n<li><code>stone</code></li>\n<li><code>red</code></li>\n<li><code>orange</code></li>\n<li><code>amber</code></li>\n<li><code>yellow</code></li>\n<li><code>lime</code></li>\n<li><code>green</code></li>\n<li><code>emerald</code></li>\n<li><code>teal</code></li>\n<li><code>cyan</code></li>\n<li><code>sky</code></li>\n<li><code>blue</code></li>\n<li><code>indigo</code></li>\n<li><code>violet</code></li>\n<li><code>purple</code></li>\n<li><code>fuchsia</code></li>\n<li><code>pink</code></li>\n<li><code>rose</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could also create your own custom <code>Color</code> objects and pass them in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-sizing\">Core Sizing</h3>\n\n<p>The next 3 constructor arguments set the sizing of the theme and are <code>gradio.themes.Size</code> objects. Internally, these Size objects hold pixel size values that range from <code>xxs</code> to <code>xxl</code>. Other CSS variables are derived from these 3 sizes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>spacing_size</code>: This sets the padding within and spacing between elements. In the default theme, this is set to <code>gradio.themes.sizes.spacing_md</code>.</li>\n<li><code>radius_size</code>: This sets the roundedness of corners of elements. In the default theme, this is set to <code>gradio.themes.sizes.radius_md</code>.</li>\n<li><code>text_size</code>: This sets the font size of text. In the default theme, this is set to <code>gradio.themes.sizes.text_md</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could modify these values using their string shortcuts, such as</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(spacing_size=\"sm\", radius_size=\"none\")) as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\nor you could use the `Size` objects directly, like this:\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(spacing_size=gr.themes.sizes.spacing_sm, radius_size=gr.themes.sizes.radius_none)) as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n    src=\"https://gradio-theme-extended-step-2.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>The predefined size objects are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>radius_none</code></li>\n<li><code>radius_sm</code></li>\n<li><code>radius_md</code></li>\n<li><code>radius_lg</code></li>\n<li><code>spacing_sm</code></li>\n<li><code>spacing_md</code></li>\n<li><code>spacing_lg</code></li>\n<li><code>text_sm</code></li>\n<li><code>text_md</code></li>\n<li><code>text_lg</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could also create your own custom <code>Size</code> objects and pass them in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-fonts\">Core Fonts</h3>\n\n<p>The final 2 constructor arguments set the fonts of the theme. You can pass a list of fonts to each of these arguments to specify fallbacks. If you provide a string, it will be loaded as a system font. If you provide a <code>gradio.themes.GoogleFont</code>, the font will be loaded from Google Fonts.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>font</code>: This sets the primary font of the theme. In the default theme, this is set to <code>gradio.themes.GoogleFont(\"Source Sans Pro\")</code>.</li>\n<li><code>font_mono</code>: This sets the monospace font of the theme. In the default theme, this is set to <code>gradio.themes.GoogleFont(\"IBM Plex Mono\")</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You could modify these values such as the following:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Default(font=[gr.themes.GoogleFont(\"Inconsolata\"), \"Arial\", \"sans-serif\"])) as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n    src=\"https://gradio-theme-extended-step-3.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"extending-themes-via-set\">Extending Themes via <code>.set()</code></h2>\n\n<p>You can also modify the values of CSS variables after the theme has been loaded. To do so, use the <code>.set()</code> method of the theme object to get access to the CSS variables. For example:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>theme = gr.themes.Default(primary_hue=\"blue\").set(\n    loader_color=\"#FF0000\",\n    slider_color=\"#FF0000\",\n)\n\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=theme) as demo:\n    ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\nIn the example above, we've set the `loader_color` and `slider_color` variables to `#FF0000`, despite the overall `primary_color` using the blue color palette. You can set any CSS variable that is defined in the theme in this manner. \n\nYour IDE type hinting should help you navigate these variables. Since there are so many CSS variables, let's take a look at how these variables are named and organized.\n\n### CSS Variable Naming Conventions\n\nCSS variable names can get quite long, like `button_primary_background_fill_hover_dark`! However they follow a common naming convention that makes it easy to understand what they do and to find the variable you're looking for. Separated by underscores, the variable name is made up of:\n\n1. The target element, such as `button`, `slider`, or `block`.\n2. The target element type or sub-element, such as `button_primary`, or `block_label`.\n3. The property, such as `button_primary_background_fill`, or `block_label_border_width`.\n4. Any relevant state, such as `button_primary_background_fill_hover`.\n5. If the value is different in dark mode, the suffix `_dark`. For example, `input_border_color_focus_dark`.\n\nOf course, many CSS variable names are shorter than this, such as `table_border_color`, or `input_shadow`. \n\n### CSS Variable Organization\n\nThough there are hundreds of CSS variables, they do not all have to have individual values. They draw their values by referencing a set of core variables and referencing each other. This allows us to only have to modify a few variables to change the look and feel of the entire theme, while also getting finer control of individual elements that we may want to modify.\n\n#### Referencing Core Variables\n\nTo reference one of the core constructor variables, precede the variable name with an asterisk. To reference a core color, use the `*primary_`, `*secondary_`, or `*neutral_` prefix, followed by the brightness value. For example:\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>theme = gr.themes.Default(primary_hue=\"blue\").set(\n    button_primary_background_fill=\"*primary_200\",\n    button_primary_background_fill_hover=\"*primary_300\",\n)\n</code></pre></div>\n\nIn the example above, we've set the `button_primary_background_fill` and `button_primary_background_fill_hover` variables to `*primary_200` and `*primary_300`. These variables will be set to the 200 and 300 brightness values of the blue primary color palette, respectively.\n\nSimilarly, to reference a core size, use the `*spacing_`, `*radius_`, or `*text_` prefix, followed by the size value. For example:\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>theme = gr.themes.Default(radius_size=\"md\").set(\n    button_primary_border_radius=\"*radius_xl\",\n)\n</code></pre></div>\n\nIn the example above, we've set the `button_primary_border_radius` variable to `*radius_xl`. This variable will be set to the `xl` setting of the medium radius size range.\n\n#### Referencing Other Variables\n\nVariables can also reference each other. For example, look at the example below:\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>theme = gr.themes.Default().set(\n    button_primary_background_fill=\"#FF0000\",\n    button_primary_background_fill_hover=\"#FF0000\",\n    button_primary_border=\"#FF0000\",\n)\n</code></pre></div>\n\nHaving to set these values to a common color is a bit tedious. Instead, we can reference the `button_primary_background_fill` variable in the `button_primary_background_fill_hover` and `button_primary_border` variables, using a `*` prefix. \n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>theme = gr.themes.Default().set(\n    button_primary_background_fill=\"#FF0000\",\n    button_primary_background_fill_hover=\"*button_primary_background_fill\",\n    button_primary_border=\"*button_primary_background_fill\",\n)\n</code></pre></div>\n\nNow, if we change the `button_primary_background_fill` variable, the `button_primary_background_fill_hover` and `button_primary_border` variables will automatically update as well.\n\nThis is particularly useful if you intend to share your theme - it makes it easy to modify the theme without having to change every variable.\n\nNote that dark mode variables automatically reference each other. For example:\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>theme = gr.themes.Default().set(\n    button_primary_background_fill=\"#FF0000\",\n    button_primary_background_fill_dark=\"#AAAAAA\",\n    button_primary_border=\"*button_primary_background_fill\",\n    button_primary_border_dark=\"*button_primary_background_fill_dark\",\n)\n</code></pre></div>\n\n`button_primary_border_dark` will draw its value from `button_primary_background_fill_dark`, because dark mode always draw from the dark version of the variable.\n\n## Creating a Full Theme\n\nLet's say you want to create a theme from scratch! We'll go through it step by step - you can also see the source of prebuilt themes in the gradio source repo for reference - [here's the source](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/themes/monochrome.py) for the Monochrome theme.\n\nOur new theme class will inherit from `gradio.themes.Base`, a theme that sets a lot of convenient defaults. Let's make a simple demo that creates a dummy theme called Seafoam, and make a simple app that uses it.\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import gradio as gr\nfrom gradio.themes.base import Base\nimport time\n\nclass Seafoam(Base):\n    pass\n\nseafoam = Seafoam()\n\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=seafoam) as demo:\n    textbox = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    slider = gr.Slider(label=\"Count\", minimum=0, maximum=100, step=1)\n    with gr.Row():\n        button = gr.Button(\"Submit\", variant=\"primary\")\n        clear = gr.Button(\"Clear\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\n\n    def repeat(name, count):\n        time.sleep(3)\n        return name * count\n\n    button.click(repeat, [textbox, slider], output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n    src=\"https://gradio-theme-new-step-1.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>The Base theme is very barebones, and uses <code>gr.themes.Blue</code> as it primary color - you'll note the primary button and the loading animation are both blue as a result. Let's change the defaults core arguments of our app. We'll overwrite the constructor and pass new defaults for the core constructor arguments.</p>\n\n<p>We'll use <code>gr.themes.Emerald</code> as our primary color, and set secondary and neutral hues to <code>gr.themes.Blue</code>. We'll make our text larger using <code>text_lg</code>. We'll use <code>Quicksand</code> as our default font, loaded from Google Fonts. </p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>from __future__ import annotations\nfrom typing import Iterable\nimport gradio as gr\nfrom gradio.themes.base import Base\nfrom gradio.themes.utils import colors, fonts, sizes\nimport time\n\n\nclass Seafoam(Base):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        *,\n        primary_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.emerald,\n        secondary_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.blue,\n        neutral_hue: colors.Color | str = colors.gray,\n        spacing_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.spacing_md,\n        radius_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.radius_md,\n        text_size: sizes.Size | str = sizes.text_lg,\n        font: fonts.Font\n        | str\n        | Iterable[fonts.Font | str] = (\n            fonts.GoogleFont(\"Quicksand\"),\n            \"ui-sans-serif\",\n            \"sans-serif\",\n        ),\n        font_mono: fonts.Font\n        | str\n        | Iterable[fonts.Font | str] = (\n            fonts.GoogleFont(\"IBM Plex Mono\"),\n            \"ui-monospace\",\n            \"monospace\",\n        ),\n    ):\n        super().__init__(\n            primary_hue=primary_hue,\n            secondary_hue=secondary_hue,\n            neutral_hue=neutral_hue,\n            spacing_size=spacing_size,\n            radius_size=radius_size,\n            text_size=text_size,\n            font=font,\n            font_mono=font_mono,\n        )\n\n\nseafoam = Seafoam()\n\nwith gr.Blocks(theme=seafoam) as demo:\n    textbox = gr.Textbox(label=\"Name\")\n    slider = gr.Slider(label=\"Count\", minimum=0, maximum=100, step=1)\n    with gr.Row():\n        button = gr.Button(\"Submit\", variant=\"primary\")\n        clear = gr.Button(\"Clear\")\n    output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\n\n    def repeat(name, count):\n        time.sleep(3)\n        return name * count\n\n    button.click(repeat, [textbox, slider], output)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n<iframe\n    src=\"https://gradio-theme-new-step-2.hf.space?__theme=light\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p>See how the primary button and the loading animation are now green?

We will cover both of them with the previously created <code>seafoam</code> theme.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Via the class instance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each theme instance has a method called <code>push_to_hub</code> we can use to upload a theme to the HuggingFace hub.</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>seafoam.push_to_hub(repo_name=\"seafoam\",\n                    version=\"0.0.1\",\n                    hf_token=\"<token>\")\n</code></pre></div>\n\n* Via the command line\n\nFirst save the theme to disk\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>seafoam.dump(filename=\"seafoam.json\")\n</code></pre></div>\n\nThen use the `upload_theme` command:\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-bash'>upload_theme\\\n\"seafoam.json\"\\\n\"seafoam\"\\\n--version \"0.0.1\"\\\n--hf_token \"<token>\"\n</code></pre></div>\n\nIn order to upload a theme, you must have a HuggingFace account and pass your [Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/quick-start#login)\nas the `hf_token` argument. However, if you log in via the [HuggingFace command line](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/quick-start#login) (which comes installed with `gradio`),\nyou can omit the `hf_token` argument.\n\nThe `version` argument lets you specify a valid [semantic version](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/) string for your theme.\nThat way your users are able to specify which version of your theme they want to use in their apps. This also lets you publish updates to your theme without worrying\nabout changing how previously created apps look. The `version` argument is optional.

Capturing these \"hard\" data points is valuable because it allows you to improve your machine learning model and make it more reliable and robust.\n\nGradio simplifies the collection of this data by including a **Flag** button with every `Interface`. This allows a user or tester to easily send data back to the machine where the demo is running. In this Guide, we discuss more about how to use the flagging feature, both with `gradio.Interface` as well as with `gradio.Blocks`.\n\n## The **Flag** button in `gradio.Interface`\n\nFlagging with Gradio's `Interface` is especially easy. By default, underneath the output components, there is a button marked **Flag**. When a user testing your model sees input with interesting output, they can click the flag button to send the input and output data back to the machine where the demo is running. The sample is saved to a CSV log file (by default). If the demo involves images, audio, video, or other types of files, these are saved separately in a parallel directory and the paths to these files are saved in the CSV file.\n\nThere are [four parameters](https://gradio.app/docs/#interface-header) in `gradio.Interface` that control how flagging works. We will go over them in greater detail.\n\n* `allow_flagging`: this parameter can be set to either `\"manual\"` (default), `\"auto\"`, or `\"never\"`.                 \n    * `manual`: users will see a button to flag, and samples are only flagged when the button is clicked.\n    * `auto`: users will not see a button to flag, but every sample will be flagged automatically. \n    * `never`: users will not see a button to flag, and no sample will be flagged. \n* `flagging_options`: this parameter can be either `None` (default) or a list of strings.\n    * If `None`, then the user simply clicks on the **Flag** button and no additional options are shown.\n    * If a list of strings are provided, then the user sees several buttons, corresponding to each of the strings that are provided. For example, if the value of this parameter is `[\"Incorrect\", \"Ambiguous\"]`, then buttons labeled **Flag as Incorrect** and **Flag as Ambiguous** appear. This only applies if `allow_flagging` is `\"manual\"`.\n    * The chosen option is then logged along with the input and output.\n* `flagging_dir`: this parameter takes a string.\n    * It represents what to name the directory where flagged data is stored.\n* `flagging_callback`: this parameter takes an instance of a subclass of the `FlaggingCallback` class\n    * Using this parameter allows you to write custom code that gets run when the flag button is clicked\n    * By default, this is set to an instance of `gr.CSVLogger`\n    * One example is setting it to an instance of `gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` which can allow you to pipe any flagged data into a HuggingFace Dataset. (See more below.)\n\n## What happens to flagged data?\n\nWithin the directory provided by the `flagging_dir` argument, a CSV file will log the flagged data. \n\nHere's an example: The code below creates the calculator interface embedded below it:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\n\ndef calculator(num1, operation, num2):\n    if operation == \"add\":\n        return num1 + num2\n    elif operation == \"subtract\":\n        return num1 - num2\n    elif operation == \"multiply\":\n        return num1 * num2\n    elif operation == \"divide\":\n        return num1 / num2\n\n\niface = gr.Interface(\n    calculator,\n    [\"number\", gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]), \"number\"],\n    \"number\",\n    allow_flagging=\"manual\"\n)\n\niface.launch()\n```\n\n<gradio-app space=\"gradio/calculator-flag-basic/\"></gradio-app>\n\nWhen you click the flag button above, the directory where the interface was launched will include a new flagged subfolder, with a csv file inside it. This csv file includes all the data that was flagged. \n\n```directory\n+-- flagged/\n|   +-- logs.csv\n```\n_flagged/logs.csv_\n```csv\nnum1,operation,num2,Output,timestamp\n5,add,7,12,2022-01-31 11:40:51.093412\n6,subtract,1.5,4.5,2022-01-31 03:25:32.023542\n```\n\nIf the interface involves file data, such as for Image and Audio components, folders will be created to store those flagged data as well. For example an `image` input to `image` output interface will create the following structure.\n\n```directory\n+-- flagged/\n|   +-- logs.csv\n|   +-- image/\n|   |   +-- 0.png\n|   |   +-- 1.png\n|   +-- Output/\n|   |   +-- 0.png\n|   |   +-- 1.png\n```\n_flagged/logs.csv_\n```csv\nim,Output timestamp\nim/0.png,Output/0.png,2022-02-04 19:49:58.026963\nim/1.png,Output/1.png,2022-02-02 10:40:51.093412\n```\n\nIf you wish for the user to provide a reason for flagging, you can pass a list of strings to the `flagging_options` argument of Interface. Users will have to select one of these choices when flagging, and the option will be saved as an additional column to the CSV.\n\nIf we go back to the calculator example, the following code will create the interface embedded below it.  \n```python\niface = gr.Interface(\n    calculator,\n    [\"number\", gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]), \"number\"],\n    \"number\",\n    allow_flagging=\"manual\",\n    flagging_options=[\"wrong sign\", \"off by one\", \"other\"]\n)\n\niface.launch()\n```\n<gradio-app space=\"gradio/calculator-flagging-options/\"></gradio-app>\n\nWhen users click the flag button, the csv file will now include a column indicating the selected option.\n\n_flagged/logs.csv_\n```csv\nnum1,operation,num2,Output,flag,timestamp\n5,add,7,-12,wrong sign,2022-02-04 11:40:51.093412\n6,subtract,1.5,3.5,off by one,2022-02-04 11:42:32.062512\n```\n\n## The HuggingFaceDatasetSaver Callback\n\nSometimes, saving the data to a local CSV file doesn't make sense. For example, on Hugging Face\nSpaces, developers typically don't have access to the underlying ephemeral machine hosting the Gradio\ndemo. That's why, by default, flagging is turned off in Hugging Face Space. However,\nyou may want to do something else with the flagged data.\n\nWe've made this super easy with the `flagging_callback` parameter.\n\nFor example, below we're going to pipe flagged data from our calculator example into a Hugging Face Dataset, e.g. so that we can build a \"crowd-sourced\" dataset:\n\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nHF_TOKEN = os.getenv('HF_TOKEN')\nhf_writer = gr.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver(HF_TOKEN, \"crowdsourced-calculator-demo\")\n\niface = gr.Interface(\n    calculator,\n    [\"number\", gr.Radio([\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]), \"number\"],\n    \"number\",\n    description=\"Check out the crowd-sourced dataset at: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/aliabd/crowdsourced-calculator-demo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aliabd/crowdsourced-calculator-demo)\",\n    allow_flagging=\"manual\",\n    flagging_options=[\"wrong sign\", \"off by one\", \"other\"],\n    flagging_callback=hf_writer\n)\n\niface.launch()\n```\n\nNotice that we define our own \ninstance of  `gradio.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` using our Hugging Face token and\nthe name of a dataset we'd like to save samples to. In addition, we also set `allow_flagging=\"manual\"`\nbecause on Hugging Face Spaces, `allow_flagging` is set to `\"never\"` by default. Here's our demo:\n\n<gradio-app space=\"gradio/calculator-flagging-crowdsourced/\"></gradio-app>\n\nYou can now see all the examples flagged above in this [public Hugging Face dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aliabd/crowdsourced-calculator-demo).\n\n![flagging callback hf](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/flagging-callback-hf.png?raw=true)\n\nWe created the `gradio.HuggingFaceDatasetSaver` class, but you can pass your own custom class as long as it inherits from `FLaggingCallback` defined in [this file](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/master/gradio/flagging.py). If you create a cool callback, contribute it to the repo! \n\n## Flagging with Blocks\n\nWhat about if you are using `gradio.Blocks`? On one hand, you have even more flexibility\nwith Blocks -- you can write whatever Python code you want to run when a button is clicked,\nand assign that using the built-in events in Blocks.\n\nAt the same time, you might want to use an existing `FlaggingCallback` to avoid writing extra code.\nThis requires two steps:\n\n1. You have to run your callback's `.setup()` somewhere in the code prior to the \nfirst time you flag data\n2. When the flagging button is clicked, then you trigger the callback's `.flag()` method,\nmaking sure to collect the arguments correctly and disabling the typical preprocessing. \n\nHere is an example with an image sepia filter Blocks demo that lets you flag\ndata using the default `CSVLogger`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef sepia(input_img, strength):\n    sepia_filter = strength * np.array(\n        [[0.393, 0.769, 0.189], [0.349, 0.686, 0.168], [0.272, 0.534, 0.131]]\n    ) + (1-strength) * np.identity(3)\n    sepia_img = input_img.dot(sepia_filter.T)\n    sepia_img /= sepia_img.max()\n    return sepia_img\n\ncallback = gr.CSVLogger()\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            img_input = gr.Image()\n            strength = gr.Slider(0, 1, 0.5)\n        img_output = gr.Image()\n    with gr.Row():\n        btn = gr.Button(\"Flag\")\n        \n    # This needs to be called at some point prior to the first call to callback.flag()\n    callback.setup([img_input, strength, img_output], \"flagged_data_points\")\n\n    img_input.change(sepia, [img_input, strength], img_output)\n    strength.change(sepia, [img_input, strength], img_output)\n    \n    # We can choose which components to flag -- in this case, we'll flag all of them\n    btn.click(lambda *args: callback.flag(args), [img_input, strength, img_output], None, preprocess=False)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n```\n<gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_flag'></gradio-app>\n\n## Privacy\n\nImportant Note: please make sure your users understand when the data they submit is being saved, and what you plan on doing with it. This is especially important when you use `allow_flagging=auto` (when all of the data submitted through the demo is being flagged)\n\n### That's all!

On one hand, you have even more flexibility\nwith Blocks -- you can write whatever Python code you want to run when a button is clicked,\nand assign that using the built-in events in Blocks.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, you might want to use an existing <code>FlaggingCallback</code> to avoid writing extra code.\nThis requires two steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You have to run your callback's <code>.setup()</code> somewhere in the code prior to the \nfirst time you flag data</li>\n<li>When the flagging button is clicked, then you trigger the callback's <code>.flag()</code> method,\nmaking sure to collect the arguments correctly and disabling the typical preprocessing. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here is an example with an image sepia filter Blocks demo that lets you flag\ndata using the default <code>CSVLogger</code>:</p>\n\n<div class='codeblock'><pre><code class='lang-python'>import numpy as np\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef sepia(input_img, strength):\n    sepia_filter = strength * np.array(\n        [[0.393, 0.769, 0.189], [0.349, 0.686, 0.168], [0.272, 0.534, 0.131]]\n    ) + (1-strength) * np.identity(3)\n    sepia_img = input_img.dot(sepia_filter.T)\n    sepia_img /= sepia_img.max()\n    return sepia_img\n\ncallback = gr.CSVLogger()\n\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\n    with gr.Row():\n        with gr.Column():\n            img_input = gr.Image()\n            strength = gr.Slider(0, 1, 0.5)\n        img_output = gr.Image()\n    with gr.Row():\n        btn = gr.Button(\"Flag\")\n\n    # This needs to be called at some point prior to the first call to callback.flag()\n    callback.setup([img_input, strength, img_output], \"flagged_data_points\")\n\n    img_input.change(sepia, [img_input, strength], img_output)\n    strength.change(sepia, [img_input, strength], img_output)\n\n    # We can choose which components to flag -- in this case, we'll flag all of them\n    btn.click(lambda *args: callback.flag(args), [img_input, strength, img_output], None, preprocess=False)\n\ndemo.launch()\n\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><gradio-app space='gradio/blocks_flag'></gradio-app></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"privacy\">Privacy</h2>\n\n<p>Important Note: please make sure your users understand when the data they submit is being saved, and what you plan on doing with it. This is especially important when you use <code>allow_flagging=auto</code> (when all of the data submitted through the demo is being flagged)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thats-all-happy-building\">That's all!
